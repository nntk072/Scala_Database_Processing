The
Alliance of Independent Social Democrats
(
Serbian
:
Савез независних социјалдемократа
,
romanized
:
Savez nezavisnih socijaldemokrata
; abbr. СНСД or
SNSD
) is a
Serb
political party in
Bosnia and Herzegovina
. Founded in 1996, it is the governing party in
Republika Srpska
, with its leader,
Milorad Dodik
, serving as the current
president of Republika Srpska
. The party's vice-president,
Željka Cvijanović
, is the current member of the
Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina
, while SNSD member
Radovan Višković
is the current
prime minister of Republika Srpska
.
The creation of the SNSD can be traced back to the Independent Members of Parliament Group, which eventually grew to become the
Party of Independent Social Democrats
. During this time, the party served as the only opposition to the dominance of the
ultra-nationalist
Serb Democratic Party
(SDS), which was led by
Radovan Karadžić
for the majority of the 1990s. The SNSD was seen as a moderate and non-extremist alternative to the SDS, with many of its members, including Milorad Dodik, being part of the former non-nationalist and multi-ethnic
Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia
.
The SNSD's first real electoral success was recorded in 2006, where it won 41 of the 83 seats in the
National Assembly of Republika Srpska
, attracting 44.95% of the popular vote. Since then, the party has gradually abandoned its reformist ideology for a more assertive advocacy of
Serbian nationalism
, threatening the
secession of Republika Srpska
from the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina numerous times.
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
This has also led to the party being expelled from the
Socialist International
in 2012 for "continuing to espouse a nationalist and extremist line".
[14]
[15]
History
[
edit
]
1991-1996
[
edit
]
The party grew out of the Independent Members of Parliament Caucus (IMPC), known as "the club", of the
National Assembly of Republika Srpska
(NSRS) in 1996.
[16]
The club was in opposition to the
Serb Democratic Party
(SDS) during the
Bosnian War
(1992-96).
[16]
The IMPC was established from the caucus of
ethnic Serb
members of the Parliament of the
Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
elected in 1990 from the election list of the
Union of Reform Forces
.
[

The Serb members of the Parliament of
SR Bosnia and Herzegovina
, the majority of the
Serb Democratic Party
(SDS), including the members of the IMPC, established the Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 24 October 1991 (later renamed National Assembly of the Republika Srpska), following the majority of the parliament (mostly
Croats
and
Bosniaks
) approved the "Memorandum on Sovereignty" on 15 October 1991. In 1992, the Bosnian parliament held
an independence referendum
which led to the declaration of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
.
Milorad Dodik
has been the party's president since its foundation in 1996
The absolute majority of the newly founded NSRS was from the SDS. The IMPC was the only parliamentary opposition from the founding of the National Assembly through the first post-war
elections in September 1996
. The Party of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) participated in the elections in the "Union for Peace and Progress" coalition along with the
Socialist Party of RS
(SPRS) and a minor party.
[16]
The club and later party (SNSD) was chaired by Milorad Dodik.
[16]
1997-2004
[
edit
]
By the time of the next local elections in 1997, about twenty municipal committees had been formed, and it ran independently in 24 municipalities of the Republic of Srpska, mainly in Krajina and Posavina.
[17]
In 1997, there was a split in the Serb Democratic Party, in which
Biljana Plavšić
, the president of Repubika Srpska left the party following internal clashes.
[18]
The People’s Assembly of Republika Srpska was dissolved and parliamentary elections were held simultaneously with local elections. The Party of Independent Social Democrats received twice as much support compared to the previous elections just a year earlier.
[17]
The then western-backed Plavšić nominated Dodik for Prime Minister and he was elected in the January 1998 elections, largely being seen as a moderate.
[16]
[19]
In the party's early years it was active in the "Sloga" (
freedom
) coalition with Plavšić's
Serb National Alliance
and the
Socialist Party
, whose leader at the time was
Živko Radišić
. In 1998 another parliamentary election was held. In the elections for the People’s Assembly of Republika Srpska, the Party of Independent Social Democrats won 6 parliamentary seats.
[17]
1999 was marked by difficulties in the region, including the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
and internal strife with the blockade of the work of the Government by the People’s Assembly, a vote of no-confidence and the removal of
Nikola Poplašen
from the post of President of Republika Srpska by the High Representative
Carlos Westendorp
. Meanwhile the government led by Dodik received significant support from international institutions.
[17]
In December 1999, the Social Liberal Party of Republika Srpska merged into the SNSD, and after local elections in 2000
Nikola Špirić
's
Democratic Socialist Party
(DSP) merged into it in 2001. The SNSD then changed its name to the "Alliance of Independent Social Democrats", keeping its old abbreviation.
[20]
DSP was a splinter party of the SPRS. At the Unifying Congress in May 2002, it elected Milorad Dodik as president of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, with
Nebojša Radmanović
as president of the Executive Committee. Vinko Đuragić's New Workers' Party also joined the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats.
[17]
In August 2002, the New Labour Party of Republika Srpska merged into the SNSD.
In the elections held on 5 October 2002, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats won the largest number of parliamentary seats since its creation, receiving 19 seats in the People’s Assembly of Republika Srpska, 3 deputies in the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 1 deputy in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Alliance of Independent Social Democrats received 7 seats in the Council of Peoples of Republika Srpska and 3 seats in the Council of Peoples of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moderate political parties were offered a partnership to form a new government, but the
Party of Democratic Progress
decided to remain in the pact with the nationalist parties, so the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats accepted the role of the strongest opposition party, not only in the Republic of Srpska, but throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.
[17]
In this period, the party launched a campaign to collect signatures, with the goal of abolishing conscription into the army and demilitarization of the country.
[17]
In the 2004 elections, with around 125,000 votes, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats became the strongest party in Republika Srpska and the second in terms of votes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 17 mayor positions were won, 15 of which were in Republika Srpska, and 2 in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The number of council seats, compared to the previous local elections four years earlier was much higher, and they were won in all candidate municipalities in Republika Srpska, and in 9 municipalities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the establishment of municipal assemblies, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats has 22 municipal presidents, and a larger number of deputy mayors and vice presidents of municipal assemblies.
[17]
The end of 2004 was marked by the resignation of the republican government headed by Dragan Mikerević. After an unsuccessful two-year mandate, the Government resigns, and the political parties of the Republic of Srpska reach an Agreement on coordinated political action, with the aim of defining the strategic relationship towards the constitutional arrangement and upcoming reforms: police and defense.

2006-present: Breakthrough and rule
[
edit
]
At the beginning of 2006, the previous prime minister of Republic of Srpska, Pero Bukejlović, resigned. Ten days after that, on 26 January 2006, the president of Republic of Srpska,
Dragan Čavić
, asked Milorad Dodik to form a new government, in which, according to the Constitution, there are 16 ministers: eight Serbs, five Bosniaks and three Croats. The Parliament of Republika Srpska supported the appointment of Dodik as Prime Minister on 28 February 2006.
The Alliance of Independent Social Democrats achieved their breakthrough in the 2006 general elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Nebojša Radmanović
was elected as the Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats won 7 seats with 269,468 votes ahead of the Party of Democratic Action with 238,474 (9 seats) and the Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina with 219,477 votes (8 seats). Milan Jelić became the President of Republika Srpska (271,022 votes, 48.87%). The party won 41 out of 83 parliamentary seats in the People’s Assembly of Republika Srpska, and Milorad Dodik, the president of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, became the representative for the composition of the new Republika Srpska government. In the House of Representatives of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats won 1 place with 12,564 votes (1.46%). The Alliance of Independent Social Democrats won 3 out of 25 seats in the Assembly of Canton 10 in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (3,654 votes, 11.99%).
[21]
In the General Elections of 2010, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats repeated their good result from 2006, and at all levels defeated the united opposition in the coalition Zajedno za Srpska (Serb Democratic Party-Party of Democratic Progress-Serb Radical Party of Republic of Srpska).
The joint candidate of the "Alliance of Independent Social Democrats-Democratic People's Alliance-Socialist Party" coalition for the Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nebojša Radmanović, received 295,629 votes, i.e. 48.92% of the total number of valid votes. The most significant opponent, the candidate of the Zajedno za Srpska coalition,
Mladen Ivanić
, received 285,951 votes, or 47.31% of valid votes. A large number of invalid ballots, and a small difference between the two most important candidates, resulted in a complaint by Mladen Ivanić and his Party of Democratic Progress about irregularities during the counting of ballots. The Central Election Commission put an end to such doubts by recognizing the election results.
[22]
Milorad Dodik, the candidate of the coalition "Alliance of Independent Social Democrats-Democratic People's Alliance-Socialist Party" for the president of Republika Srpska achieved a convincing victory, receiving the support of 50.52% of voters, i.e. 319,618 valid votes.
In the elections for the People’s Assembly of the Republic of Srpska, the party won 38% of the valid votes cast (240,727 votes) and received 37 parliamentary mandates, which was enough for the party to preserve the parliamentary majority in the coalition with the Democratic People's Alliance and the Socialist Party.

In the elections for the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the party in the Republic of Srpska won 43.30% of the votes, or 8 representatives.
[23]
The
2014 general elections
saw the SNSD enter the race with a coalition of smaller parties; the Democratic People's Alliance and the Socialist Party. The SNSD became the main ruling party of Republika Srpska for the third consecutive time, gaining 29 seats in the Assembly with Dodik re-elected.
[24]
After the
2018 general elections
, for the Serb member of the Presidency, Dodik received a record number of votes, i.e. 368,210 votes or 53.88%, while candidate Alliance for Victory Mladen Ivanić received 292,065 or 42.74%. In the People’s Assembly of Republika Srpska, SNSD remained the strongest political entity with 218,201 (31.87%) votes and 28 seats.
Ideology
[
edit
]
Reflecting a trend in Eastern Europe for
centre-left
parties, it has been characterized as a
social-democratic
party with left-leaning views on fiscal issues,
[2]
[3]
while having more conservative views on social issues.
[8]
[9]
Since the late 2000s, the party has gradually abandoned its
reformist
ideology and
confederalism
[5]
for
Russophilia
[25]
[7]
and a more aggressive advocacy of
Serbian nationalism
and
separatism
, threatening a
proposed secession of Republika Srpska
from the rest of
Bosnia and Herzegovina
numerous times.
[10]
[11]
[26]
[13]
This has also led to the party being expelled from the
Socialist International
in 2012 for continuing to "espouse a nationalist and extremist" line.

What Do You Know About Rock 'N Roll?
is the second
studio album
by Minneapolis hard rock band
Slave Raider
, released in the winter of 1988. It was the band's first album to be recorded for a major label. Despite snowballing success from a notoriously successful show at London's Marquee club, the album had little commercial success outside of the band's dedicated fan base.
Overview
[
edit
]
After an extensive tour of London, the group joined Tsangarides to record their sophomore effort. According to guitar player Nicci Wikkid, the band was impressed with Tsangarides' production skills, but felt that he was not interested in the band. The second side is a loose
rock opera
about a totalitarian society in which rock and roll has been banned. "The High Priest of Good Times" is persecuted for playing it, and sent to a prison known as the "Iron Bar Motel". Because of poor promotion by their record label, the album was unsuccessful. This led to the departure of original members Nicci Wikkid and Letitia Rae. The band was dropped soon after, coming together one more time for their independently released third album
Bigger, Badder, & Bolder
with a revamped lineup.
Lead singer Chainsaw Caine viewed the album as a progression from their debut in both technical proficiency and songwriting. Metal Forces and
Kerrang!
writers shared this point of view, giving positive reviews of the album and the group's stage antics, particularly their show at the Marquee. The rock opera section of the album was partially written in response to the
PMRC
, even though Caine stated in an interview with Kerrang! that he did not see the PMRC having any staying power.

Kerrang! was very positive of the album, as was another reviewer from Metal Forces, but an Allmusic retrospective review gave the album very negative reception. According to Metal Forces, reviews for the album were very mixed depending on if the reviewer was willing to look past the band's image.

In 2015, Divebomb Records re-mastered the first two Slave Raider albums because of their scarce availability on the CD format. The reissue includes extensive liner notes with lyrics, a short biography, and informational clips relevant to the time era of the band. The re-mastered CD has significantly less

than the original RCA distributed disc.

Redcar
is a
seaside town
on the
Yorkshire Coast
in the
Redcar and Cleveland
unitary authority
in the county of
North Yorkshire
, England. It is located 7 miles (11 km) east of
Middlesbrough
.
The
Teesside
built-up area's Redcar subdivision had a population of 37,073 at the
2011 Census
.
[1]
The town is made up of
Coatham
,
Dormanstown
,
Kirkleatham
, Newcomen, West Dyke, Wheatlands and Zetland.
[2]
It gained a
town charter
in 1922, from then until 1968 it was governed by the
municipal borough
of Redcar. Since the abolition of
County Borough of Teesside
, which existed from 1968 until 1974, the town has been
unparished
.
[3]
History
[
edit
]
Origins
[
edit
]
Redcar occupies a low-lying site by the sea; the second element of its name is from
Old Norse
kjarr
, meaning 'marsh', and the first may be either
Old English
(Anglo-Saxon)
rēad
meaning 'red' or OE
hrēod
'reed'.
[4]
[5]
The town originated as a fishing hamlet in the 14th century, trading with the larger adjacent hamlet of
Coatham
.
[5]
Until the mid-19th century it was within the parish of
Marske-by-the-Sea
- mentioned in the
Domesday book
.
Zetland lifeboat
[
edit
]
Main article:
Zetland (lifeboat)
Numerous ships have foundered off the Redcar coastline and many of their wrecks still exist.
[6]
The
Zetland
is the world's oldest surviving
lifeboat
. It was built by
Henry Greathead
of
South Shields
and is housed in a volunteer-led sea-front museum.
[7]
The lifeboat was first stationed at Redcar in 1802.
[8]
[9]
Victorian Era
[
edit
]
As seaside holidays became fashionable in the early 19th century, Redcar's facilities expanded. By 1841, Redcar had 794 inhabitants.
[10]
In 1846, work was completed on the Middlesbrough and Redcar Railway and the presently named
Redcar Central
station, created to attract tourism and trade.
[11]
[12]
Redcar's population expansion corresponded with Middlesbrough's, with the discovery in 1850 of
iron ore
in the
Eston area
of
Cleveland Hills
.
[13]
Redcar prospered as a seaside town drawing tourists attracted by eight miles of sands stretching from
South Gare
to
Saltburn-by-the-Sea
.
Plans for a pier were drawn up in 1866, but lay dormant until prompted by the announcement of plans to build a pier at
Coatham
in 1871.
[13]
[14]
Coatham Pier
was wrecked before it was completed when two sailing ships were driven through it in a storm. It had to be shortened because of the cost of repairs and was re-opened with an entrance with two
kiosks
and a
roller-skating
rink on the Redcar side, and a
bandstand
halfway along its length.
Redcar Racecourse
was created in 1875.
Redcar Pier
, another pier as well as Coatham Pier, was built in the late 1870s. In October 1880 the
brig
Luna
caused £1,000 worth of damage to this pier. In New Year's Eve 1885
SS Cochrane
demolished the landing stage.
[13]
and in 1897 the
schooner
Amarant
went through the pier. A year later, its head and bandstand burned down.
[13]
In October 1898 the Coatham Pier was almost wrecked when the
barque
Birger
struck it and the pier was thereafter allowed to disintegrate. An
anchor
from the
Birger
can be seen on the sea front pavement close to the
Zetland Lifeboat Museum
.
In 1907 a
pavilion
ballroom
was built on Redcar Pier behind the entrance kiosks and in 1928 it was extended.
[14]
A glass house for concerts was added to the remains of Coatham Pier's entrance. The presently named
Redcar East
railway station was built in 1929.
In 1929 Coatham Pier's glasshouse was replaced by the New Pavilion theatre. After the war, comedian and entertainer
Larry Grayson
coined his catchphrase "Shut that Door!" while performing there, since the stage door was open to the cold North Sea breeze.
[15]
Second World War
[
edit
]
Redcar Pier was deliberately breached (sectioned) in 1940 to prevent its use by enemy invasion forces.
[14]
As a result of sectioning, damage by a mine explosion and deterioration it was never reconnected and instead allowed to become even more dilapidated.
[16]
Post war
[
edit
]
Regent Cinema, at the location of Coatham Pier
In 1964 the New Pavilion Theatre was transformed into the Regent Cinema. The Redcar Pier pavilion continued in use after the war but storm damage led to it being declared unsafe and it was demolished in 1980-1981.
[5]
[13]
Redcar Steelworks
[
edit
]
Main article:
Teesside Steelworks
The steelworks in 2020 and 2023
The town's main employers in the post-war era were the nearby
Teesside Steelworks
at
Warrenby
, founded by
Dorman Long
in 1917, and the
ICI
Wilton
chemical works. The steel produced at
Dorman Long
was used to build the
Sydney Harbour Bridge
,
Tyne Bridge
,
Auckland Harbour Bridge
and many others. Both the Warrenby and Lackenby sites became part of
Tata Steel
when Corus was taken over in 2007, but continued to trade under the Corus name until at least February 2008. SSI bought the plant from Tata Steel in February 2011, for £320 million.
After a two-year hiatus following the mothballing of the plant in February 2010, steel was once again being made at Redcar. The Thai owners of the former Corus Plant at
Lackenby
, Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI), re-ignited the
blast furnace
, one of the largest in Europe, on 15 April 2012.
[17]
On 18 September 2015, production was paused due to the decline in steel prices.
[18]
On 28 September 2015, the plant was "mothballed" amid poor steel trading conditions across the world and a drop in steel prices.
[19]
On 2 October, the owner of the site, SSI UK, entered liquidation. On 12 October 2015 the administrator announced that there was no realistic prospect of finding a buyer and the ovens would be extinguished.

Warrenby
, Lakes Estate, Redcar East, The Ings, Ings Farm, Mickledales and Westfield.
On 5 May 2011 Redcar elected its councillors to Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council.
[20]
There was a by-election on 18 November 2011 for two vacant seats in the Zetland ward, held onto by the Liberal Democrats,
[21]
and on 19 January 2012 there was a by-election for a vacant seat in Newcomen ward subsequently gained by Labour from the Liberal Democrats.
[22]
Authority
[
edit
]
The Redcar
civil parish
existed from 1866 until 1968. A district in Redcar's name formed in 1885. Three years after the district was formed, the centuries-old
Yorkshire
authority was replaced by the
North Riding of Yorkshire
county council. The district became an
urban district
in 1894.
[3]
The
County Borough of Teesside
shown in red, previous authorities are shown with dotted lines.
The settlement's
town charter
occurred in 1922, the district was able to be styled as a
municipal borough
and the settlement as a town. The
municipal borough
was merged into the
County Borough of Teesside
in 1968, removing it from the
administrative county
however still ceremonially in the area.
[23]
The 1974 reform created the non-metropolitan
County of Cleveland
, under the Langbaurgh
non-metropolitan district
. The county was also inserted into the
North East England
region. After further changes in 1996, the district became a
unitary authority
called
Redcar & Cleveland
in the
ceremonial county
of
North Yorkshire
, the county straddling two
regions of England
.
[24]
The North East England region was sub-divided into
combined authorities
, in May 2017 the
Tees Valley
area voted for their first mayor. The Conservative candidate,
Ben Houchen
, won the election and is now in his second term.
Parliament
[
edit
]
From 1987 to 2001, the local
Member of Parliament
(MP) was
Mo Mowlam
.  From 2001 to 2010 the
MP
was
Vera Baird
.
In the 2010 general election there was a swing to the Liberal Democrats with
Ian Swales
being elected. But, in the 2015 general election,
Anna Turley
, a Labour MP, won back
Redcar
. In the snap 2017 general election, Anna Turley held onto that seat. In the general election on 12 December 2019, Anna Turley lost her seat to Conservative candidate Jacob Young with a majority of 3,527 votes. Young becomes the third conservative MP to represent Redcar, the first being Royal Naval Commander
Robert Tatton Bower
1931 to 1945 and Scarborough businessman
Wilfred Proudfoot
between 1959 and 1964 when Redcar was part of the Cleveland constituency.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
American artist
Jacob Hashimoto
(born 1973) is an American artist based in New York City. Using sculpture, painting, and installation, Hashimoto creates complex worlds from a range of modular components: bamboo-and-paper kites, model boats, even astroturf-covered blocks. His accretive, layered compositions reference video games, virtual environments, and cosmology, while also remaining deeply rooted in art-historical traditions notably, landscape-based abstraction, modernism, and handcraft.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Hashimoto was born in
Greeley, Colorado
. Much of his work materials reflect traditional Japanese culture.
[1]
Despite his strong ties to the culture, however, he has not been to Japan and does not speak the language. His connection instead comes from his Japanese-American father. His mother, on the other hand, is Irish-American.
[1]
Hashimoto grew up in
Walla Walla
,
Washington
, where his mother, who had studied art as a college student, had her own studio. Although he enjoyed drawing and creating art in her studio, he did not plan to pursue an art degree in college. During his second year at
Carleton College
, he took a
printmaking
class, changed his mind about his career, and decided to send an application to the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago
. After his acceptance, he returned home to paint and work in the studio of Keiko Hara for a year before returning to school.
[2]
It was during his senior year at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago that he began to make the kites that would appear in much of his later work. This initial experience with the kites created a means for him to shift from his position as a college student to a real-world artist.
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
Hashimoto’s career began with exhibitions designed for galleries
[2]
and has since shown work internationally in many exhibitions including
The Nature of Objects
at Studio la Città in
Verona
,
Black Sea
at
XIV Quadriennale di Roma
at
Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna
in Rome,
Made in California NOW
at the
Mary Boone Gallery
in New York and has had
The Dark Isn't The Thing To Worry About
and
In the Cosmic Fugue
at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago.
[3]
After graduating college, Hashimoto began working as a preparator in the Ann Nathan Gallery which allowed him to continue pursuing his personal art at night. On
Thanksgiving
weekend, he was allowed to set up his first kite exhibit in the gallery in order for the piece to be photographed. After which, Nathan encouraged him to leave it up as a public exhibit. Upon viewing the installation, the chief curator of the
Museum of Contemporary Art
, Richard Francis, approached Hashimoto with an offer to display works in the cafe at the MoCA. Hashimoto completed the exhibition with the aid of many family members and friends. The massive collection of 15,000 kites was displayed for 18 months.
[2]
In 2013 the installation
Superabundant Atmosphere
was presented at
Bildmuseet
, Umeå University, Sweden, to run from June 2, 2013 until October 13, 2013.
[4]
Techniques
[
edit
]
Kites
[
edit
]
Because his pieces are produced from a vast number of kites, Hashimoto enlists the help of various assistants from friends to employed workers. When it comes to the designs these assistants collage each kite, he places little restrictions on their creativity. Hashimoto must then find a way to incorporate each kite into his piece in a way that still speaks to his personal style and artistic values. This method of construction often forces him to solve unexpected formal issues and to explore ideas he would not normally encounter.
[2]
As far as idealizing his installations is concerned, Hashimoto relates his methods to those of a
painter
. He mainly follows his intuition, allowing the paper to respond to the ideas he generates in his head and the emotions he wishes to communicate through his work.
[2]
The paper Hashimoto uses for his kites is manufactured in Japan by four or five specific
paper mills
. Without this paper, it would be difficult to produce the effects he strives to create in his work (such as
opacity
,
transparency
, and diverse
color
) as paper made in the
United States
does not exhibit the same qualities. When collaging with this paper, he uses a variety of papers such as
natural fiber
paper,
rayon
, traditional
rice paper
, and
Washi paper
.
[2]
Waterblocks
[
edit
]
Waterblocks
is the name Hashimoto has given to his 3-D wave-like sculptures. Using a
3-D computer program
, he creates these acrylic glass sculptures by altering, layering, and combining different blocks. The blocks are then arranged on the floor in a grid format, replicating the movement of water that has been frozen in this seemingly fragile form. The way in which he layers and arranges the forms is similar to how he works with his kites and also resembles the manipulation of clay.
[2]
Exhibitions
[
edit
]
Hashimoto's exhibit in the Ronchini Gallery.
Hashimoto's exhibits display his numerous paper kites and sometimes other mediums as well. The paper kites hang from the ceiling and vary in layers, anywhere from six kites deep to the entire length of the gallery.
[2]
His collections of hundreds to thousands of kites are made from both colored and white paper. Although Hashimoto claims his work to be abstract and without narrative, he admits that his installations often reference various landscapes.
[2]
Landscapes of Vision
[
edit
]
This exhibit is a large collection of pieces that all represent nature, some intentionally more abstract than others. One piece, created in 2008, is a wooden tree,
Tree III,
that holds giant white balls of light in place of leaves. The design is intended to resemble growing technology and children's playground equipment.
[5]
The original idea was to hang 700 smaller balls of light from the ceiling that would place the viewer in a digital reality. Hashimoto had the goal of making a sculpture that was both digital and physical. But, to better approach the space at Studio La Città, a wooden tree was made. The idea of a tree came from images of trees that were dotted with paper prayers in the branches. A tree that became sacred while representing the influence of the digital world in American society, especially American children, was the position Hashimoto was aiming for.
[5]
Another part of this exhibit was a giant two-dimensional piece against the wall, made in 2008, named
Diving Deep and Surfacing
. This piece is built up with layers and layers of grass that appear artificial. Hashimoto admits that this piece came from inspiration from his previous exhibits. The grass had been applied to his many kite exhibits, but he had never attached the grass to a simple square shape before this exhibit. The ground approaching this piece is covered in a black sculpture. These black acrylic bases, called
Gun Metal Blue Waves
, also made in 2008, are designed based on ocean waves. Pushing the limits between digital and organic creations, Hashimoto created an organic sculpture from a mass digital creation. The black color is intended to force the viewer to notice the waves, despite the non-naturalistic colors.
[5]
A third room in the exhibit held the piece
Infinite Expanse of Sky
and
Superabundant Atmosphere.
Both of these works have been exhibited together previously.
Infinite Expanse of Sky
is a collection of rectangle kites that are blue with white clouds drawn on them. The original sculpture was created in 1998.
Superabundant Atmosphere
is a collection of white, oval kites. This piece was started originally exhibited in 2005. The slight variations between different exhibit locations include increasing the length and decreasing the width of the experience and placing the two pieces next to each other with the blue kites on the left and the white kites on the right. A bench was added at the front of the room. The seat gives the vantage point that Hashimoto determined is the most ideal for viewing the entirety of the piece. The kites are well above the viewer's head at the entrance of the room, but as the piece extends further back, the kites gradually become lower, until they hit the floor.
[5]
Other, more 2-dimensional kite works that were displayed in the
Landscapes of Vision
exhibit included
Hodge Podge
, 2008;
Grassscape,
2008;
Descending Yellow Halo
, 2008;
Field of Green Blocks
, 2008;
Water for Elephants
, 2008;

, 2008;
Field of Yellow Blocks
, 2009;
Odds and Ends
, 2008;
Far Rockaway
, 2009; and
The Return
, 2009. There were also several rectangle paintings on paper and linen. These included
Vapors and Night Skies
, 2008;
Inverted Night Reflection
, 2008;
Single Black Cloud
, 2008;
Some Things You Can't Ignore
, 2008; and
Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel
, 2008. Of the painted pieces, all were done in acrylic. The first four listed are in all painted in greyscale.
Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel
is the only acrylic piece made with multiple colors.
[5]
Gas Giant
[
edit
]
This exhibit is made to be set up in two separate rooms. The first room consists of mostly black and white elements and is designed to lead the viewer into the second room. The second room is the focal point of the exhibit. An entire environment is created with the hanging paper kites. Square pieces with grass glued on collect in one corner. White, oval kites start low and lead the eye towards the ceiling where there is a multitude of shapes forming out of colorful kites.
[1]
The exhibit was displayed a total of three times starting in 2012 at the Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago. It was then moved to the Fondazione Querini Stampalia and finally the MOCA Pacific Design Center.
[1]
Influences
[
edit
]
Hashimoto claims that the idea that a piece can fully surround the viewer while maintaining some form of two-dimensionality comes from pieces made by
Mark Rothko
. Staring at a Rothko piece gave the idea of standing in a literal field of color and Hashimoto wanted to replicate that.
[2]
Although Oriental influence appears frequently in his work, Hashimoto claims to be affected by other elements as well. For example, during his time at school, much of his work reflected the styles of
Robert Ryman
and
Agnes Martin
and he adopted the strict grid format from both artists.
[2]
Inspired by
Jessica Stockholder
and
Ann Hamilton
's ability to turn a painting into a sculpture, Hashimoto took the first steps to surrounding and involving the viewer directly.

In the
mathematical
field of
graph theory
, the
Dejter graph
is a 6-regular graph with 112 vertices and 336 edges.
[1]
[2]
[3]
[4]
[5]
[6]
[7]
The Dejter graph is
obtained by deleting a copy
of the
Hamming code
of length 7 from the binary
7-
cube
.
The Dejter graph, and by extension any graph obtained by deleting a
Hamming code
of length 2
r
-1 from a
(2
r
-1)-
cube
, is a
symmetric graph
.
In particular, the Dejter graph admits a 3-
factorization
into two
copies of the
Ljubljana graph
, which is the third smallest existing
semi-symmetric
cubic graph
of regular degree 3. The Ljubljana graph has girth 10.
In fact, it is proven that the Dejter graph can be 2-colored, say in the color set {red, blue}, as in the top figure to the right, so that both the resulting edge-monochromatic red and blue vertex-spanning subgraphs are copies of the
Ljubljana graph
. These two copies contain exactly the 112 vertices of the Dejter graph and 168 edges each, having both copies girth 10, while the Dejter graph has girth 6 and the 7-cube girth 4. It seems that the Dejter graph is the smallest
symmetric graph
having a connected self-complementary vertex-spanning
semi-symmetric
cubic subgraph.
Both the red and blue vertex-spanning Ljubljana subgraphs of the Dejter graph can be presented as
covering graphs
of the
Heawood graph
, namely as 8-covers of the
Heawood graph
. This is suggested in each of the two representations of the
Ljubljana graph
, (red above, blue below, both to the right), by alternately coloring the inverse images of successive vertices of the
Heawood graph
, say in black and white (better viewed by twice clicking on images for figure enlargements), according to the
Heawood graph
bipartition
. Each such inverse image is formed by the 8 neighbors, along a fixed coordinate direction of the 7-cube, of the half of the Hamming code having a fixed weight, 0 or 1. By exchanging these weights via the permutation (0 1), one can pass from the adjacency offered by the red Ljubljana graph to the one offered by the blue Ljubljana graph, or vice versa.
One seventh of the Dejter graph appears in a separate figure down below that can be obtained from the two resulting copies of the
Heawood graph
.

Fifth Avenue
in
New York City
to commemorate
Casimir Pulaski
, a
Polish
hero of the
American Revolutionary War
. The parade runs from 35th to 54th Streets passing by
St. Patrick's Cathedral
. It is held on the first Sunday of October and closely coincides with the October 11th
General Pulaski Memorial Day
, a national observance of his death at the
Siege of Savannah
. The parade features Polish dancers, Polish Supplementary schools and organizations, Polish soccer teams and their mascots, scouts of the
Polish Scouting and Guiding Association
, and Polish Government ambassadors and representatives.6
[1]
The Parade was first held in 1937. Its founder was
Francis J. Wazeter
, president of the Downstate New York division of the Polish American Congress.
[2]
There was no parade in 1942 nor 2020.

The Man Who Never Was
is a
1966
ABC-TV
20th Century Fox Television
television series  starring
Robert Lansing
and
Dana Wynter
. It has no connection with the better-known earlier 20th Century Fox
book and film of the same name
, and ran for only one season of 18 episodes between September 7, 1966, and January 4, 1967. It was produced by
20th Century Fox Television
, was filmed in Europe with the pilot episode being filmed in Berlin and Munich.
[1]
John Newland
produced and directed most of the episodes.

The original
television pilot
starred Canadian actor
Don Harron
as Mark Wainwright but a change in sponsor led to the new sponsor requesting Robert Lansing in the role.
[3]
Plot
[
edit
]
Lansing initially plays the dual role of Peter Murphy, an American spy, and Mark Wainwright, an influential playboy millionaire who is his exact double. One evening, as the spy is being chased through the streets, he sees Wainwright drunkenly stumbling out of a bar. Stunned at the physical resemblance, Murphy unwittingly allows enemy agents to kill Wainwright, after which he assumes his identity. Although Wainwright's wife, Eva, realises immediately that Murphy is not her husband, she allows him to continue the impersonation, partly because it is financially convenient, and partly because she is moved by his kind treatment of her, in comparison to her abusive husband. Murphy and Eva eventually fall in love. In the final episode, "I Take This Woman", which aired on January 4, 1967, Murphy decides to quit being a secret agent. He proposes marriage to Eva, who accepts, which ended the series, making this one of the few TV shows to have a definite ending. Two movies were later made by editing episodes together, "The Spy with the Perfect Cover" and "Danger Has Two Faces"; both have the final scene from the last episode, but one version of it was re-filmed with the same dialogue.

William Dean Windley

was an

who played with
South Melbourne
in the
Victorian Football League
(VFL).
Football
[
edit
]
Windley was one of South Melbourne's veteran players when they started out in the VFL, having played in the VFA since 1886, and been a regular selection since 1888. He had been a member of their 1888, 1889 and 1890 premiership teams, and their 1896 team that was beaten in the premiership play-off match.
An elusive player, he was a centreman in the VFA, but was often used as a rover later on in his career and also spent some time up forward. In the VFL, he captained South Melbourne in 1900 and 1902, and also played in their losing
1899 Grand Final
team.
Off the field, he worked for
The Argus
newspaper for 55 years from 1881 to his retirement in 1936.
Windley retired after Round 16 of 1905, one week after his 37th birthday, and was later a trainer and equipment manager at South Melbourne; his career total of 265 games remained the club record until it was broken by Michael O'Loughlin in Round 19 of 2007, 102 years after Windley's last match, 54 years after his death, and 26 years after the Swans' relocation to Sydney.
[3]
At the time, Windley's 265 games was also second in elite Victorian football behind his former South Melbourne teammate Peter Burns (305 games, 216 in the VFA and 89 in the VFL), and equal third in elite Australian rules football with South Australian George "Geordie" Webb (played 238 games in the SAFA and 27 in the WAFA, and retired at the end of 1905), being behind Burns and the South Australian Jack "Dinny" Reedman (293 games, would retire in 1909 with 319 games).

John Lankester Parker
OBE
FRAeS
Hon.
MSLAE
[1]
(1896 - 22 August 1965) was Chief
Test Pilot
for
Short Brothers
from 1918 until his retirement in 1945. He joined Shorts in
1916
as a part-time test pilot and assistant to then Chief Test Pilot
Ronald Kemp
,
[2]
having been recommended for the post by
Captain
, later Admiral Sir,
Murray Sueter
,
RNAS
.
[3]
By the time he retired he was a director of the company.
First flying experience
[
edit
]
He gained his first flying experience as a pilot and instructor flying for the
Northern Aircraft Company
's Seaplane School based in
Windermere
, where he flew, first as a pupil
[4]
and then as an instructor,
[5]
between 1914 and 1916. It was during this time that he made the acquaintance of
Murray Sueter
,
Ronald Kemp
and
Oscar Gnosspelius
, all of whom would figure later in his work at Shorts.
In 1916, he joined the
Prodger-Isaacs Syndicate
of freelance test pilots, working for several British aircraft manufacturers.
Shorts
[
edit
]
His first assignment with Shorts began on 17 October 1916, when he was asked by
Horace Short
to test fly a batch of six
Short Bombers
from the
Eastchurch
airfield. In spite of his relative youth, his flying skills impressed Horace Short, who soon offered him a permanent position as assistant to Ronald Kemp.
He became Chief Test Pilot for Short Brothers in 1918 as successor to Ronald Kemp.
Between 1918 and his last official flight as Chief Test Pilot on 22 August 1945 he flew every Shorts prototype on its maiden flight, ranging from the diminutive
Short Satellite
(640 lb (290 kg)) to the very large
Short Shetland
(75,860 lb (34,410 kg)). During the course of his long association with the company, especially during the early pioneering years, he survived numerous forced landings, both on land and on water.
He was awarded the OBE in June 1942.
[6]
In 1943 he became a Director of Short Brothers and Harland Ltd., Belfast,
[7]
resigning from the Board in 1958.
[8]
Other activities
[
edit
]
Parker was a long-time member of the
Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators
, serving as its Master from 1951 until 1953 and again from 1956 until 1957.
[9]
In 1948 he was the first recipient of the Guild's Brackley Memorial Trophy, "awarded to a transport pilot(s) or navigator(s), for outstanding flying, contributing to the operational development of air transport, or transport aircraft, or of new techniques in air transport flying."
[10]
In 1964 he succeeded
Lord Douglas of Kirtleside
as President of the
Seaplane Club of Great Britain
.
[11]
In memory of his long association with the Medway area, a road in
Rochester, Kent
was named after him.

The
history of the United Kingdom
began in the early eighteenth century with the
Treaty of Union
and
Acts of Union
. The core of the
United Kingdom
as a unified state came into being in 1707 with the
political union
of the kingdoms of
England
and
Scotland
,
[1]
into a new unitary state called
Great Britain
.
[a]
Of this new
state
of Great Britain, the historian
Simon Schama
said:
What began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership in the most powerful
going concern
in the world... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in
European history
.
[2]
The
Act of Union 1800
added the
Kingdom of Ireland
to create the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
.
The first decades were marked by
Jacobite risings
which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the
Battle of Culloden
in 1746. In 1763,
victory in the Seven Years' War
led to the growth of the
First British Empire
. With defeat by the
United States
,
France
and
Spain
in the
War of American Independence
, Great Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a
Second British Empire
based in Asia and Africa. As a result,
British culture
, and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide. Politically the central event was the
French Revolution
and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The
Tories
, who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included
Palmerston
,
Disraeli
,
Gladstone
, and
Salisbury
. Culturally, the
Victorian era
was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and
maintained a generally peaceful century
from 1815 to 1914. The
First World War
(1914-1918), with Britain in alliance with France,
Russia
and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with
Germany
. The resulting
League of Nations
was a favourite project in
Interwar Britain
. However, while the Empire remained strong, as did the
London financial markets
, the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and, especially, the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of
Hitler
's Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of
Poland
in 1939 started the
Second World War
. In the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the US joined the UK as
the main Allied powers
.
Britain was no longer a military or economic superpower, as seen in the
Suez Crisis
of 1956. Britain no longer had the wealth to maintain an empire, so it granted independence to almost all its possessions.

The new states typically joined the
Commonwealth of Nations
. The postwar years saw great hardships, alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the United States, and some from
Canada
. Prosperity returned in the 1950s. Meanwhile, from 1945 to 1950, the
Labour Party
built a welfare state, nationalized many industries, and created the
National Health Service
. The UK took a strong stand against
Communist
expansion after 1945, playing a major role in the
Cold War
and the formation of
NATO
as an anti-Soviet military alliance with West Germany, France, the United States, Canada and smaller countries.
NATO
remains a powerful military coalition. The UK has been a leading member of the
United Nations
since its founding, as well as numerous other international organizations. In the 1990s,
neoliberalism
led to the privatisation of nationalised industries and significant deregulation of business affairs. London's status as a world financial hub grew continuously. Since the 1990s, large-scale
devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales
have decentralised political decision-making. Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. It joined the
European Economic Community
in 1973, thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. However, the
Brexit
referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the
European Union
, which it did in 2020.
In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland seceded to become the
Irish Free State
; a day later,
Northern Ireland
seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1927, the United Kingdom changed its formal title to the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
[3]
usually shortened to
Britain
and (after 1945) to the
United Kingdom
or
UK
.

The
Kingdom of Great Britain
came into being on 1 May 1707, as a result of the
political union
of the
Kingdom of England
(which included
Wales
) and the
Kingdom of Scotland
under the
Treaty of Union
. This combined the two kingdoms into a single kingdom and merged the two parliaments into a single
parliament of Great Britain
.
Queen Anne
became the first monarch of the new Great Britain. Although now a single kingdom, certain institutions of Scotland and England remained separate, such as
Scottish
and
English law
; and the
Presbyterian
Church of Scotland
and the
Anglican
Church of England
. England and Scotland each also continued to have their own system of education.
Meanwhile, the
War of the Spanish Succession
against France (1701-1714) was underway. It see-sawed back and forth until a more peace-minded government came to power in London and the treaties of
Utrecht
and
Rastadt
ended the war. British historian
G. M. Trevelyan
argues:
That
Treaty [of Utrecht]
, which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large,—the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.

Main article:
House of Hanover
George I in 1714, by Godfrey Kneller
The Stuart line died with Anne in 1714, although a die-hard faction with French support supported pretenders. The Elector of Hanover became king as
George I
. He paid more attention to Hanover and surrounded himself with Germans, making him an unpopular king.
[5]
He did, however, build up the army and created a more stable political system in Britain and helped bring peace to northern Europe.
[6]
Jacobite factions seeking a Stuart restoration remained strong; they instigated
a revolt in 1715-1716
. The son of
James II
planned to invade England, but before he could do so,
John Erskine, Earl of Mar
, launched an invasion from Scotland, which was easily defeated.
[7]
George II
enhanced the stability of the constitutional system, with a government run by
Robert Walpole
during the period 1730-1742.
[8]
He built up the
First British Empire
, strengthening the colonies in the Caribbean and North America. In coalition with the rising power Prussia, the United Kingdom defeated France in the
Seven Years' War
(1756-1763), and won full control of Canada.
[9]
George III
never visited Hanover, and spoke English as his first language. Reviled by Americans as a tyrant and the instigator of the American War of Independence, he was insane off and on after 1788, and his eldest son served as regent.
[10]
He was the last king to dominate government and politics, and his long reign is noted for losing the first British Empire in the
American Revolutionary War
(1783), as France sought revenge for its defeat in the Seven Years' War by aiding the Americans.
[11]
The reign was notable for the building of a second empire based in India, Asia and Africa, the beginnings of the industrial revolution that made Britain an economic powerhouse, and above all the life and death struggle with the French, in the
French Revolutionary Wars
1793-1802, which ended inconclusively with a short truce, and the epic
Napoleonic Wars
(1803-1815), which ended with the decisive defeat of Napoleon.
[12]
South Sea Bubble
[
edit
]
Entrepreneurs gradually extended the range of their business around the globe. The
South Sea Bubble
was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a joint-stock company in London. Its ostensible object was to grant trade monopolies in South America; but its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to £31 million through
market manipulation
and speculation. It raised money four times in 1720 by issuing stock, which was purchased by about 8,000 investors. The share price kept soaring every day, from £130 a share to £1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.
Robert Walpole
managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.
[13]
Robert Walpole
[

Robert Walpole is now generally regarded as the first Prime Minister, from, 1719-1742, and indeed he invented the role.

The term was applied to him by friends and foes alike by 1727. Historian Clayton Roberts summarizes his new functions:
He monopolized the counsels of the King, he closely superintended the administration, he ruthlessly controlled patronage, and he led the predominant party in Parliament.
[14]
Walpole was a master of the effective use of patronage, as were his two disciples who succeeded him as prime minister,
Henry Pelham
and Pelham's brother the
Duke of Newcastle
.

Moralism, benevolence and hypocrisy
[
edit
]
18th-century London
by
William Hogarth
Hypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The
Toleration Act 1689
allowed for certain rights for religious minorities, but Protestant
Nonconformists
(such as Congregationalists and Baptists) were still deprived of important rights, such as the right to hold office. Nonconformists who wanted to hold office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged. They outlawed what they called "occasional conformity" in 1711 with the
Occasional Conformity Act 1711
.
[16]
In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation. This campaign of moderation versus zealotry peaked in 1709 during the impeachment trial of high church preacher
Henry Sacheverell
. Historian Mark Knights argues that by its very ferocity, the debate may have led to more temperate and less hypercharged political discourse. "Occasional conformity" was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.
[17]
English author
Bernard Mandeville
's famous "
Fable of the Bees
" (1714) explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. On one hand, Mandeville was a "moralist" heir to the French Augustinianism of the previous century, viewing sociability as a mere mask for vanity and pride. On the other, he was a "materialist" who helped found modern economics. He tried to demonstrate the universality of human appetites for corporeal pleasures. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced
Adam Smith
and 19th-century
Utilitarianism
. A tension arose between these two approaches concerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviour, and the historical variability of human cultures.
[18]
From around 1750 to 1850, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding and counselling reform initiatives to prevent the outbreaks of popular discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy—alleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power while preserving their precious aristocratic exclusiveness. Historian L.G. Mitchell defends the Whigs, pointing out that thanks to them radicals always had friends at the centre of the political elite, and thus did not feel as marginalised as in most of Europe. He points out that the debates on the 1832 Reform Bill showed that reformers would indeed receive a hearing at parliamentary level with a good chance of success.
[19]
Meanwhile, a steady stream of observers from the Continent commented on the English political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the English lower classes in the early 19th century, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the aristocracy, and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. There were not so many conservative visitors. They praised the stability of English society, its ancient constitution, and reverence for the past; they ignored the negative effects of industrialisation.
[20]
Historians have explored crimes and vices of England's upper classes, especially duelling, suicide, adultery and gambling. They were tolerated by the same courts that executed thousands of poor men and boys for lesser offenses. No aristocrat was punished for killing someone in a duel. However the emerging popular press specialized in sensationalistic stories about upper-class vice, which led the middle classes to focus their critiques on a decadent aristocracy that had much more money, but much less morality than the middle class.
[21]
Warfare and finance
[
edit
]
John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough
accepts the French surrender at
Blenheim
, 1704
From 1700 to 1850, Britain was involved in 137 wars or rebellions. It maintained a relatively large and expensive
Royal Navy
, along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in the sources of government financing, from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes; and, after 1790, an income tax. Working with bankers in the city, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.
[22]
The
French Revolution
polarised British political opinion in the 1790s, with conservatives outraged at the killing of the king, the expulsion of the nobles, and the
Reign of Terror
. Britain was at war against France almost continuously from 1793 until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Conservatives castigated every radical opinion in Britain as "Jacobin" (in reference to the
leaders of the Terror
), warning that radicalism threatened an upheaval of British society. The Anti-Jacobin sentiment, well expressed by
Edmund Burke
and
many popular writers
was strongest among the landed gentry and the upper classes.

(c. 1762)
The
Seven Years' War
, which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale, fought in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and coastal Africa. Britain was the big winner as it enlarged its empire at the expense of France and others. France lost its role as a colonial power in North America. It ceded
New France
to Britain, putting a large, traditionalistic French-speaking Catholic element under British control. Spain ceded
Florida
to Britain, but it only had a few small outposts there. In India, the
Carnatic War
had left France still in control of its
small enclaves
but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain.
The British victory over France
in the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's dominant colonial power.
[24]
During the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the
Thirteen Colonies
and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of growing anger against Parliament's repeated attempts to tax American colonists without their consent.
[25]
The Americans readied their large militias, but were short of gunpowder and artillery. The British assumed falsely that they could easily suppress Patriot resistance. In 1775 the
American Revolutionary War
began. In 1776 the Patriots expelled all the royal officials and
declared the independence of the United States of America
. After capturing a British invasion army in 1777, the new nation formed an alliance with France (and in turn Spain aided France), equalizing the military and naval balance and putting Britain at risk of invasion from France. The British army controlled only a handful of coastal cities in the U.S. 1780-1781 was a low point for Britain. Taxes and deficits were high, government corruption was pervasive, and the war in America was entering its sixth year with no apparent end in sight. The
Gordon Riots
erupted in London during the spring of 1780, in response to increased concessions to Catholics by Parliament. In October 1781
Lord Cornwallis
surrendered his army at
Yorktown, Virginia
. The
Treaty of Paris
was signed in 1783, formally terminating the war and recognising the independence of the United States. The peace terms were very generous to the new nation, which London hoped correctly would become a major trading partner.

The loss of the Thirteen Colonies, at the time Britain's most populous colonies, marked the transition between the "first" and "second" empires,
[27]
in which Britain shifted its attention to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa.
Adam Smith
's
Wealth of Nations
, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that
free trade
should replace the old
mercantilist
policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783
[28]
confirmed Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.
During its first 100 years of operation, the focus of the
British East India Company
had been trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the British East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the
La Compagnie française des Indes orientales
, during the
Carnatic Wars
of the 1740s and 1750s. The British, led by
Robert Clive
, defeated the French and their Indian allies in the
Battle of Plassey
, leaving the Company in control of
Bengal
and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force of the
Indian Army
, 80% of which was composed of native Indian
sepoys
.

James Cook
discovered the eastern coast of Australia

while on a scientific

to the South Pacific. In 1778,
Joseph Banks
, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of
Botany Bay
for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of
convicts
set sail, arriving in 1788.
British Empire in 1921
The British government had somewhat mixed reactions to the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, and when war broke out on the Continent in 1792, it initially remained neutral. But the following January,
Louis XVI
was beheaded. This combined with a threatened invasion of the Netherlands by France spurred Britain to declare war. For the next 23 years, the two nations were at war except for a short period in 1802-1803. Britain alone among the nations of Europe never submitted to or formed an alliance with France. Throughout the 1790s, the British repeatedly defeated the navies of France and its allies, but were unable to perform any significant land operations. An Anglo-Russian invasion of the Netherlands in 1799 accomplished little except the capture of the Dutch fleet.
At the threshold to the 19th century, Britain was challenged again by France under
Napoleon
, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations: the constitutional monarchy of Great Britain versus the liberal principles of the French Revolution ostensibly championed by the Napoleonic empire.
[30]
It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened invasion of Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun.

Act of Union 1800
and
Irish issue in British politics
On 1 January 1801, the first day of the 19th century, the
Great Britain
and
Ireland
joined to form the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
.
The legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was brought about by the Act of Union 1800, creating the "
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
". The Act was passed in both the Parliament of Great Britain and the
Parliament of Ireland
, dominated by the
Protestant Ascendancy
and lacking representation of the country's Catholic population. Substantial majorities were achieved, and according to contemporary documents this was assisted by bribery in the form of the awarding of
peerages
and
honours
to opponents to gain their votes.
[31]
Under the terms of the merger, the separate Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland were abolished, and replaced by a united
Parliament of the United Kingdom
. Ireland thus became an integral part of the United Kingdom, sending around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28
representative peers
to the House of Lords, elected from among their number by the Irish peers themselves, except that Roman Catholic peers were not permitted to take their seats in the Lords. Part of the trade-off for the Irish Catholics was to be the granting of
Catholic Emancipation
, which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by
King George III
, who argued that emancipating the Roman Catholics would breach his
Coronation Oath
. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined the appeal of the Union.

[33]
During the
War of the Second Coalition
(1799-1801), Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch colonies (the Netherlands had been a satellite of France since 1796), but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the Treaty of Amiens created a pause, Britain was forced to return most of the colonies. In May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon's plans to invade Britain failed due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805, Lord Nelson's fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at
Trafalgar
, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars.
In 1806, Napoleon issued the series of
Berlin Decrees
, which brought into effect the
Continental System
. This policy aimed to weaken the British export economy closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Napoleon hoped that isolating Britain from the Continent would end its economic dominance. It never succeeded in its objective. Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. Britain's naval supremacy meant that France could never enjoy the peace necessary to consolidate its control over Europe, and it could threaten neither the home islands nor the main British colonies.
The Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The
Duke of Wellington
and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and
von Blücher
defeated Napoleon once and for all at
Waterloo
.
[34]
Financing the war
[
edit
]
A key element in British success was its ability to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.
[35]
Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The British budget in 1814 reached £66 million, including £10 million for the Navy, £40 million for the Army, £10 million for the Allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The whole cost of the war came to £831 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.
[36]
Napoleon also attempted economic warfare against Britain, especially in the
Berlin Decree
of 1806. It forbade the import of British goods into European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and installed the
Continental System
in Europe. All connections were to be cut, even the mail. British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war.
[37]
There was some damage to Britain, especially in 1808 and 1811, but its control of the oceans helped ameliorate the damage. Even more damage was done to the economies of France and its allies, which lost a useful trading partner.
[38]
Angry governments gained an incentive to ignore the Continental System, which led to the weakening of Napoleon's coalition.
[39]
War of 1812 with United States
[
edit
]
Signing of the Treaty of Ghent (December 1812) with the U.S. diplomats
Simultaneous with the Napoleonic Wars, trade disputes and British impressment of American sailors led to the
War of 1812
with the United States. This was the "Second War of Independence" for the Americans, though in reality, it was never about British efforts to conquer the former colonies, but about the conquest of the Canadian colonies by the Americans.
[40]
It was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American
frigates
also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe. A stepped-up war effort that year brought about some successes such as the burning of Washington, but many influential voices such as the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the US was impossible.
[41]
Peace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but
Andrew Jackson
, unaware of this, won a great victory over the British at the
Battle of New Orleans
in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). Ratification of the Treaty of Ghent ended the war in February 1815. The major result was the permanent defeat of the Indian allies the British had counted upon. The US-Canada border was demilitarised by both countries, and peaceful trade resumed, although worries of an American conquest of Canada persisted into the 1860s.
Postwar reaction: 1815-1822
[
edit
]
The postwar era was a time of economic depression, poor harvests, growing inflation, and high unemployment among returning soldiers. As industrialisation progressed, Britain was more urban and less rural, and power shifted accordingly.
[42]
The dominant Tory leadership, based in the declining rural sector, was fearful, reactionary and repressive. Tories feared the possible emergence of radicals who might be conspiring to emulate the dreaded
French Revolution
. In reality the violent radical element was small and weak; there were a handful of small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed.
[43]
Techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to arrest and hold suspects without cause or trial). Sidmouth's Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week. In reaction to the
Peterloo massacre
of 1819, the Liverpool government passed the "
Six Acts
" in 1819. They prohibited drills and military exercises; facilitated warrants for the search for weapons; outlawed public meetings of more than 50 people, including meetings to organize petitions; put heavy penalties on blasphemous and seditious publications; imposing a fourpenny stamp act on many pamphlets to cut down the flow on news and criticism. Offenders could be harshly punished including exile in Australia. In practice the laws were designed to deter troublemakers and reassure conservatives; they were not often used. By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.
[44]
A weak ruler as regent (1811-1820) and king (1820-1830),
George IV
let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. The principle now became established that the king accepts as prime minister the person who wins a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favours him or not. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed.
[45]
His brother
William IV
ruled 1830 to 1837, but was little involved in politics. His reign saw several reforms: the
poor law
was updated,
child labour
restricted,
slavery abolished
in nearly all the
British Empire
, and, most important, the
Reform Act 1832
refashioned the British electoral system.
[46]
There were no major wars until the
Crimean War
of 1853-1856.
[47]
While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas. Britain intervened in Portugal in 1826 to defend a constitutional government there and recognising the independence of Spain's American colonies in 1824.
[48]
British merchants and financiers, and later railway builders, played major roles in the economies of most Latin American nations.
[49]
The British intervened in 1827 on the side of the Greeks, who had been waging the
Greek War of Independence
against the Ottoman Empire since 1821.
Whig reforms of the 1830s
[
edit
]
The
Whig Party
recovered its strength and unity by supporting moral reforms, especially the reform of the electoral system, the abolition of slavery and emancipation of the Catholics.
Catholic emancipation
was secured in the
Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829
, which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Britain.
[50]
The Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made
Lord Grey
prime minister 1830-1834, and the
Reform Act 1832
became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise slightly and ended the system of
rotten and pocket boroughs
(where elections were controlled by powerful families), and gave seats to new industrial centres. The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society.
[50]
After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.
Chartism
emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote to the working class. Activists denounced the 'betrayal' of the working class and the 'sacrificing' of their interests by the 'misconduct' of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of MPs (so poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. Elites saw the movement as pathological, so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th-century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.
[51]
In 1832, Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the
Slavery Abolition Act 1833
. The government purchased the slaves for £20,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.

Victorian era
[
edit
]
Main article:
Victorian era
Queen Victoria (1837-1901)
Victoria
ascended the throne in 1837 at age 18. Her long reign until 1901 saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power. Exciting new technologies such as steam ships, railways, photography, and telegraphs appeared, making the world much faster-paced. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics, and it was not affected by the wave of revolutions in 1848. The Victorian era saw the fleshing out of the second
British Empire
. Scholars debate whether the Victorian period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians—actually begins with her coronation or the earlier passage of the
Reform Act 1832
. The era was preceded by the
Georgian era
and succeeded by the
Edwardian period
.
Historians like Bernard Porter have characterized the mid-Victorian era, (1850-1870) as Britain's 'Golden Years.'.
[53]
There was peace and prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half. Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialization, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of trade and engineering that produce profits for British merchants and experts from across the globe. There was peace abroad (apart from the short Crimean war, 1854-1856), and social peace at home. Reforms in industrial conditions were set by Parliament. For example, in 1842, the nation was scandalized by the use of children in coal mines. The
Mines Act of 1842
banned employment of girls and boys under ten years old from working underground in coal mines.
[54]
Opposition to the new order melted away, says Porter. The Chartist movement, peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies. The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity. Employers typically were paternalistic, and generally recognized the trade unions.
[55]
Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia. Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes aspire to middle-class norms of 'respectability.'
There was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free. Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal. There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism. Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, which controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military. Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate. Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music. The educational system was mediocre; the capstone universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre.
[56]
Historian
Llewellyn Woodward
has concluded:
[57]
For leisure or work, for getting or spending, England was a better country in 1879 than in 1815. The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor. There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age. The public conscience was more instructed, and the content of liberty was being widened to include something more than freedom from political constraint.... Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise. The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town & country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.
According to historians David Brandon and Alan Brooke, the
new system of railways after 1830
brought into being our modern world:
They stimulated demand for building materials, coal, iron and, later, steel. Excelling in the bulk movement of coal, they provided the fuel for the furnaces of industry and for domestic fireplaces. Millions of people were able to travel who had scarcely ever travelled before. Railways enabled mail, newspapers, periodicals and cheap literature to be distributed easily, quickly and cheaply allowing a much wider and faster dissemination of ideas and information. They had a significant impact on improving diet....[and thus] a proportionately smaller agricultural industry was able to feed a much larger urban population.... They employed huge quantities of labour both directly and indirectly. They helped Britain to become the 'Workshop of the World' by reducing transport costs not only of raw materials but of finished goods, large amounts of which were exported.... Today's global corporations originated with the great limited liability railway companies.... By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, there was scarcely any person living in Britain whose life had not been altered in some way by the coming of the railways. Railways contributed to the transformation of Britain from a rural to a predominantly urban society.

Many European companies, such as steam-machine producer

The Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s. Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment,
[59]
it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule and an informal one based on the British pound.

Main articles:
Eastern question
and
International relations (1814-1919)
One nagging fear was the possible collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was well understood that a collapse of that country would set off a scramble for its territory and possibly plunge Britain into war. To head that off Britain sought to keep the Russians from occupying Constantinople and taking over the Bosporous Straits, as well as from threatening India via Afghanistan.
[61]
In 1853, Britain and France intervened in the
Crimean War
and defeated Russia at a very high cost in casualties.
[62]
In the 1870s the
Congress of Berlin
blocked Russia from imposing the harsh Treaty of San Stefano on the Ottoman Empire.
[63]
Despite its alliance with the French in the Crimean War, Britain viewed the Second Empire of
Napoleon III
with some distrust, especially as the emperor constructed ironclad warships and began returning France to a more active foreign policy.
American Civil War
[

Main article:
United Kingdom and the American Civil War
During the
American Civil War
(1861-1865), British leaders personally disliked American republicanism and favoured the more aristocratic
Confederacy
, as it had been a major source of cotton for textile mills, but the country never recognized the Confederacy and neither signed a treaty with it. Prince Albert was effective in defusing a
war scare in late 1861
. The British people, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the United States. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, Britain (along with France) contemplated stepping in and negotiating a peace settlement, which could only mean war with the United States. But in the same month, US president
Abraham Lincoln
announced the
Emancipation Proclamation
would be issued in January 1863 making abolition of slavery in the Confederacy a war goal. Since support of the Confederacy now meant support for slavery, there was no longer any possibility of European intervention. However, the British working class were quite overwhelmingly pro-Union. In the end, although Britain could survive without Southern cotton, the North's meat and grain was more important to feed the UK's urban population, especially as a series of bad harvests had affected British agriculture in the late 1850s to early 1860s.
[64]
Meanwhile, the British sold arms to both sides, built
blockade runners
for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy. The warships caused a major diplomatic row that was resolved in the
Alabama Claims
in 1872, in the Americans' favour.
[65]
Empire expands
[
edit
]
In 1867, Britain united most of its North American colonies as
Canada
, giving it self-government and responsibility for its internal affairs. Britain handled foreign policy and defence. The second half of the 19th century saw a major expansion of Britain's colonial empire in Asia and Africa as well as the Pacific. In the "
Scramble for Africa
", the boast was having the Union Jack flying from "Cairo to Cape Town." Britain defended its empire with the world's dominant navy, and a small professional army. It was the only power in Europe to have no conscription.
[66]
The rise of the
German Empire
after 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States) threatened to take Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor
Otto von Bismarck
succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When
William II
became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain's.
[67]
Boer War
[
edit
]
Main article:
Second Boer War
Siege of Ladysmith
in South Africa
Ever since Britain had taken control of South Africa from the Netherlands in the
Napoleonic Wars
, it had run afoul of the Dutch settlers who further away and created two republics of their own. The British imperial vision called for control over the new countries and the Dutch-speaking "Boers" (or "
Afrikaners
") fought back in the
War in 1899-1902
. British historian
Andrew Roberts
argues that the Boers insisted on keeping full control of both their two small republics, allowing no role whatever for nonwhites, and distinctly limited roles for British and other European settlers. These "
Uitlanders
" were the base of the economy, paid 80 per cent of the taxes, and had no vote. The Transvaal was in no sense a democracy, argues Roberts, for no black, Briton, Catholic, or Jew was allowed to vote or hold any office. Johannesburg was the business centre, with 50,000 primarily British residents, but was not permitted any local government. The English language was banned in official proceedings; no public meetings were permitted; newspapers were closed down arbitrarily; and full citizenship was technically possible but quite rare. Roberts says President
Paul Kruger
"ran a tight, tough, quasi-police state from his state capital, Pretoria." the British government officially protested; while theoretically recognizing the Transvaal's right to manage its internal affairs, cabinet member
Joseph Chamberlain
detailed the many ways how Uitlanders were mistreated as second-class non-citizens, despite their essential role in producing prosperity.
[68]
The Boer response to the British pressure was to declare war on 20 October 1899. The 410,000 Boers were massively outnumbered, but amazingly they waged a successful guerrilla war, which gave the British regulars a difficult fight. The Boers were landlocked and did not have access to outside help. The weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics eventually brought about a British victory. To defeat the guerrillas, the British rounded up their women and children into concentration camps, where many died of disease. World outrage focused on the camps, led by a large faction of the Liberal Party in Britain. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into
Union of South Africa
in 1910; it had internal self-government but its foreign policy was controlled by London and was an integral part of the British Empire.
[69]

The unexpectedly great difficulty in defeating the Boers forced a reevaluation of British policy. In military terms, it was clear that the Cardwell reforms had been inadequate. The call to establish a general staff to control military operations had been shelved by the
Duke of Cambridge
, himself a royal with enormous authority. It took a five more years to set up a general staff and other Army reforms, under the administration of
Lord Haldane
.
[70]
The Royal Navy was now threatened by Germany. Britain responded by a massive building programme launched in 1904 by the highly controversial
First Sea Lord, John Fisher
. He launched
HMS
Dreadnought
in 1906. It was the first modern battleship, based on new armour, new propulsion, new guns and gunnery that made all other warships obsolete.
[71]
The Boer War demonstrated that Britain was not loved around the world—it had more enemies than friends and its policy of "
splendid isolation
" was one of high risk. It needed new friends. It made a military alliance with Japan, and buried old controversies to forge a close relationship with the United States.

Ireland and Home Rule

Main articles:
Irish issue in British politics
and
Great Famine (Ireland)
Part of the agreement which led to the
Act of Union 1800
stipulated that the Penal Laws in Ireland were to be repealed and
Catholic Emancipation
granted. However, King George III blocked emancipation. A campaign under
Daniel O'Connell
led to the concession of Catholic Emancipation in 1829, allowing Catholics to sit in Parliament.
[73]
When
potato blight
hit Ireland in 1846, much of the rural population was left without food. Relief efforts were inadequate and hundreds of thousands died in the
Great Hunger
.
[74]
Millions more migrated to England, or to North America. Ireland became permanently smaller in terms of population
In the 1870s new moderate nationalist movement was formed. As the
Irish Parliamentary Party
it became a major factor in parliament under
Charles Stewart Parnell
. Home Rule Bills introduced by Liberal Prime Minister Gladstone failed of passage, and split the Liberals. A significant
unionist minority
(largely based in
Ulster
), opposed Home Rule, fearing that a
Catholic-Nationalist
parliament in Dublin would discriminate against them and would also hurt its industry.
[75]
Parliament passed laws in 1870, 1881, 1903 and 1909 that enabled most tenant farmers to purchase their lands, and lowered the rents of the others.
[76]
Leadership
[
edit
]
Historically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals.
[77]
However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. High Society in London, following the Queen, largely ostracized home rulers, and Liberal clubs were badly split.
Joseph Chamberlain
took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party, the
Liberal Unionists
, which collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party.
[78]
The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted
The Newcastle Programme
that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation, and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the Nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.
[79]
Queen Victoria
[
edit
]
Queen Victoria
played a small role in politics, but became the iconic symbol of the nation, the empire, and proper, restrained behaviour.
[80]
Her strength lay in good common sense and directness of character; she expressed the qualities of the British nation which at that time made it preeminent in the world. As a symbol of domesticity, endurance and Empire, and as a woman holding the highest public office during an age when middle- and upper-class women were expected to beautify the home while men dominated the public sphere, Queen Victoria's influence has been enduring. Her success as ruler was due to the power of the self-images she successively portrayed of innocent young woman, devoted wife and mother, suffering and patient widow, and grandmotherly matriarch.
[81]
Palmerston
[
edit
]
Lord Palmerston
dominated foreign policy for decades, through a period when Britain was at the height of its power, serving terms as both Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister.
[82]
He became controversial at the time, and remains so today, for his aggressive bullying and his "liberal interventionist" policies. He was intensely patriotic; he used the Royal Navy to undermine the
Atlantic slave trade
.
[83]
Disraeli
[
edit
]
Benjamin Disraeli
Disraeli and Gladstone dominated the politics of the late 19th century, Britain's golden age of parliamentary government. They long were idolized, but historians in recent decades have become much more critical, especially regarding Disraeli.
[84]
Benjamin Disraeli
(
prime minister 1868 and 1874-1880
) remains an iconic hero of the
Conservative Party
. He played a central role in the creation of the Party, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the Liberal leader William Gladstone, and his
one-nation conservatism
or "Tory democracy". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the
British Empire
. He was born into a Jewish family, which became Episcopalian when he was 12 years old.
[85]
Disraeli fought to protect established political, social, and religious values and elites; he emphasized the need for national leadership in response to radicalism, uncertainty, and materialism.
[86]
He is especially known for his enthusiastic support for expanding and strengthening the
British Empire
in India and Africa as the foundation of British greatness, in contrast to Gladstone's negative attitude toward imperialism. Gladstone denounced Disraeli's policies of territorial aggrandizement, military pomp, and imperial symbolism (such as making the Queen Empress of India), saying it did not fit a modern commercial and Christian nation.
In foreign policy he is best known for battling and besting Russia. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the
Eastern Question
—the slow decay of the
Ottoman Empire
and the desire of Russia to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the
Suez Canal Company
(in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the
Congress of Berlin
to maintain peace in the Balkans and made terms favourable to Britain which weakened Russia, its longstanding enemy.
[87]
Disraeli's old reputation as the "Tory democrat" and promoter of the welfare state has faded as historians argue that he had few proposals for social legislation in 1874-1880, and that the
1867 Reform Act
did not reflect a vision for the unenfranchised working man.
[88]
However he did work to reduce class antagonism, for as Perry notes, "When confronted with specific problems, he sought to reduce tension between town and country, landlords and farmers, capital and labour, and warring religious sects in Britain and Ireland—in other words, to create a unifying synthesis."
[89]
Gladstone
[
edit
]
William Gladstone
Further information:
Gladstonian liberalism
William Ewart Gladstone
was the Liberal counterpart to Disraeli, serving as
prime minister four times (1868-1874, 1880-1885, 1886, and 1892-1894)
.
[90]
He was the moral compass of the Liberal Party and is famous for his oratory, his religiosity, his liberalism, his rivalry with Disraeli, and for his poor relations with the Queen. Although he personally was not a Nonconformist, and rather disliked them in person, he formed a coalition with the Nonconformists that gave the Liberals a powerful base of support.
[91]
Gladstone's first ministry saw many reforms including Disestablishment of the Protestant
Church of Ireland
and the introduction of
secret voting
. His party was defeated in 1874, but made a comeback based on opposition to the Ottoman Empire's
Bulgarian atrocities
against Christians. Gladstone's
Midlothian Campaign
of 1879-1880 was an pathbreaking introduction of many modern political campaigning techniques. His Liberal party was increasingly pulled apart on the Irish issue. He proposed Irish
home rule
in 1886; It failed to pass and the resulting split in the Liberal Party kept it out of office for most of the next 20 years.
Gladstone's financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and
laissez-faire
, were suited to a developing capitalist society but could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the "Grand Old Man" later in life, he was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to British workers and lower middle class. The deeply religious Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics with his evangelical sensibility and opposition to aristocracy. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria, who strongly favoured Disraeli), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal party. His foreign policy goal was to create a European order based on cooperation rather than conflict and mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the rule of law was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious
Concert of Europe
was opposed to and ultimately defeated by the Germans with a
Bismarckian
system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.
[92]
Regarding Ireland, the major Liberal efforts focused on land reform with the
Land Acts
, and the
disestablishment
of the (Anglican)
Church of Ireland
through the
Irish Church Act 1869
. Gladstone became a champion of
Home Rule
, but it caused a deep split in the Liberal Party.
Joseph Chamberlain
formed the breakaway
Liberal Unionist Party
that refused to consider Home Rule for Ireland and became allied with the Conservatives.
[93]
In terms of historic reforms, Gladstone's first ministry 1868-1874 was his most successful.
[94]
He was an idealist who insisted that government should take the lead in making society more efficient, more fair, and that the government should expand its role in society in order to extend liberty and toleration.
[95]
The
Education Act of 1870
made universal schooling a major national policy.
[96]
The justice system was made up of multiple overlapping and conflicting courts dating back centuries. The
Judicature Act of 1873
merged them into one central court.
[97]
In local government the challenges of sanitation and clean water in fast-growing cities were met with new powers in the realm of public health. Local government was streamlined in a later Gladstone ministry, and made more powerful and standardized. Patronage and favouritism were replaced by civil service examinations, downplaying the role of family and aristocracy and emphasizing the role of talent and ability. The secret ballot was enacted in 1872 to prevent the buying of votes—politicians would not pay out the money if they were not sure how the person voted. The
Trade Union Act 1871
lessened the intimidation of employers, made unions legal, and protected their funding from lawsuits. The Protestant
Church of Ireland
was disestablished. Catholics no longer had to pay taxes to it.
[98]
While the Navy was in fine shape, the Army was not. Its organization was confused, its policies unfair, and its punishments were based chiefly on flogging. At the county level, politicians named the officers of the county militia units, preferring connections in class over capacity. The regular army called for enlistments for 21 years, but with reforms initiated by
Edward Cardwell
, Gladstone's
War Secretary
, enlistments were reduced to six years, plus six years in the reserves. Regiments were organized by territorial districts, and advanced with modern rifles. The complex chain of command was simplified, and in wartime the county militias were under the control of the central war office. The purchase of officers' commissions was abolished, as was flogging in peacetime. The reforms were not quite complete, the
Duke of Cambridge
, as
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces
, still had great authority, despite his mediocre abilities.
[99]
Historians have given Gladstone high marks on his successful reform programme.
[100]
Salisbury
[
edit
]
Historians agree that
Lord Salisbury
as foreign minister and prime minister in the late 19th century was a strong and effective leader in foreign affairs. He had a superb grasp of the issues, and proved:
:a patient, pragmatic practitioner, with a keen understanding of Britain's historic interests....He oversaw the partition of Africa, the emergence of Germany and the United States as imperial powers, and the transfer of British attention from the Dardanelles to Suez without provoking a serious confrontation of the great powers.
[101]
Conservative Prime Minister
Lord Salisbury
was a "talented leader who was an icon of traditional, aristocratic conservatism".
[102]
Salisbury was "a great foreign minister, [but] essentially negative, indeed reactionary in home affairs".
[103]
Another historian's estimate is more favourable; he portrays Salisbury as a leader who "held back the popular tide for twenty years."
[104]
"[I]nto the 'progressive' strain of modern Conservatism he simply will not fit."
[105]
One historian pointed to "the narrow cynicism of Salisbury".
[106]
One admirer of Salisbury agrees that Salisbury found the democracy born of the 1867 and 1884
Reform Acts
as "perhaps less objectionable than he had expected—succeeding, through his public persona, in mitigating some part of its nastiness."

welfare reforms
that created a basic British welfare state. It weakened the veto power of Lords, blocked woman suffrage. In 1914 it apparently "solved" the problem of Irish Home Rule but when the war broke out the solution was shelved.
H. H. Asquith
was Liberal Prime Minister between 1908 and 1916, followed by
David Lloyd George
, 1916-1922. Although Asquith was the Party leader, the dominant Liberal was Lloyd George. Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister, and Lloyd George replaced him as the coalition prime minister in late 1916 but Asquith remained Liberal party leader. The two fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process.
[108]
Historian
Martin Pugh
in
The Oxford Companion to British History
argues that Lloyd George:
made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader, thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain's social welfare system (especially medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions, largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land). Furthermore, in foreign affairs he played a leading role in winning the First World War, redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference, and partitioning Ireland.

Edwardian era 1901-1914
[
edit
]
Main article:
Edwardian era
Queen Victoria died in 1901 and her son
Edward VII
became king, inaugurating the Edwardian Era, which was characterised by great and ostentatious displays of wealth in contrast to the sombre Victorian Era. With the advent of the 20th century, things such as motion pictures, automobiles, and aeroplanes were coming into use. The new century was characterised by a feeling of great optimism. The social reforms of the last century continued into the 20th with the
Labour Party
being formed in 1900. Edward died in 1910, to be succeeded by
George V
, who reigned 1910-1936. Scandal-free, hard working and popular, George V was the British monarch who, with Queen Mary, established the modern pattern of exemplary conduct for British royalty, based on middle-class values and virtues. He understood the overseas Empire better than any of his prime ministers and used his exceptional memory for figures and details, whether of uniforms, politics, or relations, to good effect in reaching out in conversation with his subjects.
[110]
The era was prosperous but political crises were escalating out of control.
George Dangerfield
(1935) identified the "strange death of liberal England" as the multiple crisis that hit simultaneously in 1910-1914 with serious social and political instability arising from the Irish crisis,
labour unrest
, the women's suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed the Army might refuse orders dealing with Northern Ireland.
[111]
No solution appeared in sight when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold.
Ross McKibbin
argues that the political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance on the eve of the war in 1914. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish Nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), free collective bargaining for trades unions (which Conservatives opposed), an active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together from leftovers from the 1890s. The sociological basis was non-Anglican religion and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasized by Labour.
[112]
First World War
[

]
Main articles:
British entry into World War I
and
History of the United Kingdom during the First World War
On 4 August, the King declared war on Germany and Austria, following the advice of Prime Minister
H. H. Asquith
of the
Liberal Party
. The rest of the Empire automatically followed. The cabinet's basic reasons for declaring war focused on a deep commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals led by Asquith and Foreign Secretary
Edward Grey
threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France. That would deeply split the party and mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or to the Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition. However, the large antiwar element among Liberals, with David Lloyd George as spokesperson, would support the war to honour the 1839 treaty that guaranteed Belgian neutrality. So Belgium rather than France was the public reason given. Posters took the line that Britain was required to go to war to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839
Treaty of London
.
[113]
"The Scrap of Paper - Enlist Today", 1914 British propaganda poster emphasizes German contempt for the 1839 treaty that guaranteed Belgian neutrality as merely a "scrap of paper" that Germany would ignore.
Britain actually entered the war to support France, which had entered to support Russia, which in turn had entered to support Serbia. Britain became part of the
Triple Entente
with France and Russia, which (with smaller allies) fought the
Central Powers
of Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire. After a few weeks the
Western Front
turned into a killing ground in which millions of men died but no army made a large advance. The main British contribution was financial—loans and grants helped Russia, Italy and smaller allies afford the war.
[114]
The stalemate required an endless supply of men and munitions. By 1916, volunteering fell off, the government imposed conscription in Britain (but not in Ireland) to keep up the strength of the
Army
. With his slow start and mobilization of national resources, H. H. Asquith had proven inadequate: he was more of a committee chairman, and he started to drink so heavily after midday that only his morning hours were effective.
[115]
Asquith was replaced in December 1916 with the much more effective
David Lloyd George
. He had strong support from Unionists and considerable backing of Labour, as well as a majority of his own Liberal Party, although Asquith turned hostile. Lloyd George answered the loud demands for a much more decisive government by setting up a new small war cabinet, a cabinet secretariat under
Maurice Hankey
, and a secretariat of private advisors in the '
Garden Suburb
'; he moved towards prime ministerial control.
[116]
Britain eagerly supported the war, but Irish Nationalist opinion was divided: some served in the British Army, but the
Irish Republican Brotherhood
plotted an
Easter Rebellion
in 1916. It quickly failed but the brutal repression that followed turned that element against Britain, as did failed British plans to introduce conscription in Ireland in 1917.
[117]
The nation now successfully mobilised its manpower, womanpower, industry, finances, Empire and diplomacy, in league with France and the U.S. to defeat the enemy.
[118]
The
British Army
had traditionally never been a large employer in the nation, with the regular army standing at 250,000 at the start of the war.
[119]
By 1918, there were about five million people in the army and the fledgling
Royal Air Force
, newly formed from the
Royal Naval Air Service
(RNAS) and the
Royal Flying Corps
(RFC), was about the same size of the pre-war army. The economy grew about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943). The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from New York banks. After the U.S. entered in April 1917, the Treasury borrowed directly from the U.S. government.
[120]
The Royal Navy dominated the seas, defeating the smaller German fleet in the only major naval battle of the war, the
Battle of Jutland
in 1916. Germany was blockaded, leading to an increasing shortage of food. Germany's naval strategy increasingly turned towards use of
U-boats
to strike back against the British, despite the risk of triggering war with the powerful neutral power, the United States. Berlin declared the water routes to Britain were war zones where any ship, neutral or otherwise, was a target. Nevertheless, international route law required giving the crew and passengers an opportunity to get into their lifeboats. In May 1915, a U-boat, without warning, torpedoed the British passenger liner
Lusitania
; it sank in 18 minutes, drowning over 1000 helpless civilians including over 100 Americans. Vigorous protests by American President Woodrow Wilson forced Berlin to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. With victory over Russia in 1917, the German high command now calculated it could finally have numerical superiority on the Western Front. Planning for a massive spring offensive in 1918, it resumed the sinking of all merchant ships without warning, even if they were flying the American flag. The US entered the war alongside the Allies (without officially joining them), and provided the needed money and supplies to sustain the Allies' war efforts. The U-boat threat was ultimately defeated by a convoy system across the Atlantic.
[121]
On other fronts, the British, French, New Zealanders, Australians, and Japanese seized Germany's colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the
Gallipoli Campaign
and in
Mesopotamia
(Iraq), while arousing the Arabs who helped expel the Turks from their lands. Exhaustion and
war-weariness
were growing worse in 1917, as the fighting in France continued with no end in sight. After defeating Russia, the Germans tried to win in the spring of 1918 before the millions of American soldiers arrived. They failed, and they were overwhelmed by August and finally accepted an Armistice on 11 November 1918, that amounted to a surrender
[122]
British society and government were radically transformed by the repeated calls for manpower, the employment of women, the dramatic increase in industrial production and munitions, price controls and rationing, and the wide and deep emotional patriotism dedicated to winning the war. Parliament took a backseat, as new departments bureaus committees and operations were created every week, experts were consulted, and the prime minister's
Orders in Council
replaced the slow legislative process. Even after peace arrived, the new size and dynamism had permanently transformed the effectiveness of British government.
[123]
David Lloyd George, also a Liberal, was the high-powered Minister of Munitions who replaced Asquith in late 1916. He gave energy and dynamism to the war effort with his remarkable ability to convince people to do what he wanted and thus get ideas put into actual useful high-speed motion. His top aide Winston Churchill said of Lloyd George: "He was the greatest master of the art of getting things done and of putting things through that I ever knew; in fact no British politician my day has possessed half his competence as a mover of men and affairs."
[124]
Victorian attitudes and ideals that had continued into the first years of the 20th century changed during the First World War. The almost three million casualties were known as the "
Lost Generation
", and such numbers inevitably left society scarred. The lost generation felt its sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like
Siegfried Sassoon
's
Blighters
criticising the ill-informed
jingoism
of the home front. The lost generation was politically inert, and never had its chance to make a generational change in political power. The young men who governed Britain in 1914 were the same old men who governed Britain in 1939.
[125]
Postwar settlement
[
edit
]
The war had been won by Britain and its allies, but at a terrible human and financial cost, creating a sentiment that wars should never be fought again. The
League of Nations
was founded with the idea that nations could resolve their differences peacefully, but these hopes were unfulfilled. The harsh peace settlement imposed on Germany would leave it embittered and seeking revenge.
At the
Paris Peace Conference of 1919
, Lloyd George, American President Woodrow Wilson and French premier Georges Clemenceau made all the major decisions. They formed the
League of Nations
as a mechanism to prevent future wars. They sliced up the losers to form new nations in Europe, and divided up the German colonies and Ottoman holdings outside Turkey. They imposed what appeared to be heavy financial reparations (but in the event were of modest size). They humiliated Germany by forcing it to declare its guilt for starting the war, a policy that caused deep resentment in Germany and helped fuel reactions such as Nazism. Britain gained the German colony of
Tanganyika
and part of
Togoland
in Africa, while its dominions added other colonies. Britain gained League of Nations mandates over Palestine, which had been partly promised as a homeland for Jewish settlers, and Iraq. Iraq became fully independent in 1932. Egypt, which had been a British protectorate since 1882, became independent in 1922, although the British remained there until 1952.

Main articles:
Irish Home Rule bills
,

, and
Irish War of Independence
In 1912 the House of Commons passed a new Home Rule bill. Under the
Parliament Act 1911
the House of Lords retained the power to delay legislation by up to two years, so it was eventually enacted as the
Government of Ireland Act 1914
, but suspended for the duration of the war. Civil war threatened when the Protestant-Unionists of Northern Ireland refused to be placed under Catholic-Nationalist control. Semi-military units were formed ready to fight—the
Unionist
Ulster Volunteers
opposed to the Act and their Nationalist counterparts, the
Irish Volunteers
supporting the Act. The outbreak of the World War in 1914 put the crisis on political hold. A disorganized
Easter Rising
in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Nationalist demands for independence. Prime Minister Lloyd George failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the December 1918 General Election
Sinn Féin
won a majority of Irish seats. Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the
First Dáil
parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by
Dáil Éireann
, the self-declared Republic's parliament in January 1919. An
Anglo-Irish War
was fought between Crown forces and the
Irish Republican Army
between January 1919 and June 1921. The war ended with the
Anglo-Irish Treaty
of December 1921 that established the
Irish Free State
.
[127]
Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became
Northern Ireland
and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland.
[128]
Britain officially adopted the name "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" by the
Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927
.
Interwar era 1918-1939
[
edit
]
Main article:
Interwar Britain
Historian
Arthur Marwick
sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the Great War, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energized self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial woman suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. The chaperone faded away; village druggists sold contraceptives. Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.
[129]
Popular culture
[
edit
]
As a leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.
[130]
The annual vacation became common. Tourists flocked to seaside resorts;
Blackpool
hosted 7 million visitors a year in the 1930s.
[131]
Organized leisure was primarily a male activity, with middle-class women allowed in at the margins. There were class differences with upper-class clubs, and working-class and middle-class pubs.
[132]
Heavy drinking declined; there were more competitions that attracted heavy betting. Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for the average Englishman, and his interest in spectator sports increased dramatically. By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages and genders in very large numbers, with young women taking the lead.
[133]
Working-class men wearing flat caps and eating fish and chips were boisterous football spectators. They sang along at the music hall, fancied their pigeons, gambled on horse racing, and took the family to Blackpool in summer. The cartoon realization of this life style
Andy Capp
began in 1957. Political activists complained that working-class leisure diverted men away from revolutionary agitation.
[134]
Cinema and radio
[
edit
]
Film director Alfred Hitchcock, 1955
The British film industry emerged in the 1890s when cinemas in general broke through in the western world, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors and producers.
[135]
The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 per cent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile—the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets.
Bollywood
(based in Bombay) dominated the huge Indian market.
[136]
The most prominent directors remaining in London were
Alexander Korda
, an expatriate Hungarian, and
Alfred Hitchcock
. There was a revival of creativity in the 1933-1945 era, especially with the arrival of Jewish filmmakers and actors fleeing the Nazis.
[137]
Meanwhile, giant palaces were built for the huge audiences that wanted to see Hollywood films. In Liverpool 40 per cent of the population attended one of the 69 cinemas once a week; 25 per cent went twice. Traditionalists grumbled about the American cultural invasion, but the permanent impact was minor.
[138]
In radio, British audiences had no choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC, a government agency which had a monopoly on broadcasting.
John Reith
, an intensely moralistic engineer, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, "All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement.... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance."
[139]
Sports
[
edit
]
Main article:
Sport in the United Kingdom
The British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play.
[130]
Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.
[140]
Cricket reflected the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire (except Canada). Test matches began by the 1870s; the most famous are those between Australia and England for
The Ashes
.
[141]
Reading
[
edit
]
As literacy and leisure time expanded after 1900, reading became a popular pastime. New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stock, and saw heavy demand for new fiction.
[142]
A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by
Allen Lane
at
Penguin Books
in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's. Penguin aimed at an educated middle class "middlebrow" audience. It avoided the downmarket image of American paperbacks. The line signalled cultural self-improvement and political education.
[143]
However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on
Paternoster Square
in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.
[144]
Romantic fiction was especially popular, with
Mills and Boon
the leading publisher.
[145]
Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy.
[146]
[147]
Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by
DC Thomson
; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.
[148]
Politics and economics of the 1920s
[
edit

Expanding the welfare state
[
edit
]
Two major programmes that permanently expanded the welfare state passed in 1919 and 1920 with surprisingly little debate, even as the Conservatives dominated parliament. The
Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919
set up a system of government housing that followed the 1918 campaign promises of "homes fit for heroes." This "Addison Act", named after the first Minister of Health,
Christopher Addison
, required local authorities to survey their housing needs and start building houses to replace slums. The Treasury subsidized the low rents. In England and Wales 214,000 houses were built, and the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing.
[149]
The
Unemployment Insurance Act 1920
passed at a time of very little unemployment. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. Historian
Charles Mowat
calls these two laws "Socialism by the back door", and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.
[149]
Conservative control
[
edit
]
The
Lloyd George ministry
fell apart in 1922.
Stanley Baldwin
, as leader of the Conservative Party (1923-1937) and as Prime Minister (in 1923-1924, 1924-1929 and 1935-1937), dominated British politics.
[150]
His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the
National Government
. He was the last party leader to win over 50% of the vote (in the
general election of 1931
). Baldwin's political strategy was to polarize the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle.
[151]
The polarization did take place and while the Liberals remained active under Lloyd George, they won few seats and were a minor factor until they
joined a coalition with the Conservatives
in 2010. Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1945 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as admirers of Churchill made him the Conservative icon. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.
[152]
Labour won the 1923 election, but in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority.
McKibbin finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.
[153]
Economics
[
edit
]
Taxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterwards. Much of the money went for the dole, the weekly unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor.
A. J. P. Taylor
argues most people "were enjoying a richer life than any previously known in the history of the world: longer holidays, shorter hours, higher real wages."
[154]
The British economy was lackluster in the 1920s, with sharp declines and high unemployment in heavy industry and coal, especially in Scotland and Wales. Exports of coal and steel fell in half by 1939 and the business community was slow to adopt the new labour and management principles coming from the US, such as
Fordism
, consumer credit, eliminating surplus capacity, designing a more structured management, and using greater economies of scale.
[155]
For over a century the shipping industry had dominated world trade, but it remained in the doldrums despite various stimulus efforts by the government. With the very sharp decline in world trade after 1929, its condition became critical.
[156]
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Winston Churchill
put Britain back on the gold standard in 1925, which many economists blame for the mediocre performance of the economy.
[157]
Others point to a variety of factors, including the inflationary effects of the World War and supply-side shocks caused by reduced working hours after the war.
[157]
By the late 1920s, economic performance had stabilised, but the overall situation was disappointing, for Britain had fallen behind the United States as the leading industrial power. There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of south Wales and the industrial north of England became known as "distressed areas" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the
standard of living
continued to improve as local councils built
new houses
to let to families rehoused from outdated
slums
, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms and electric lighting now being included in the new properties. The private sector enjoyed a housebuilding boom during the 1930s.
[158]
Labour
[
edit
]
During the war,
trade unions
were encouraged and their membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918. They peaked at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.
[159]
Coal was a sick industry; the best seams were being exhausted, raising the cost. Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The
1926 general strike
was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3 million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2 million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices.
[160]
The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the
Trades Union Congress
(TUC), an umbrella organization of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the
Comintern
in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as
Ernest Bevin
considered it a mistake . Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.
[161]
The
Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927
made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. The coal industry used up the more accessible coal and as costs rose output fell from 2567 million tons in 1924 to 183 million in 1945.
[162]
The Labour government nationalised the mines in 1947.
Great Depression
[
edit
]
Main article:
Great Depression in the United Kingdom
The
Great Depression
originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterized the US, Germany, Canada and Australia in the 1920s, so its bust appeared less severe.
[163]
Britain's world trade fell in half (1929-1933), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment. Experts tried to remain optimistic.
John Maynard Keynes
, who had not predicted the slump, said, "'There will be no serious direct consequences in London. We find the look ahead decidedly encouraging."
[164]
On the left figures such as
Sidney
and
Beatrice Webb
,
J. A. Hobson
, and
G. D. H. Cole
repeated the warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention.
[165]
Starting in 1935 the
Left Book Club
provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.
[166]
Particularly hardest hit by economic problems were the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales; unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on the dole.
In 1936, by which time unemployment was lower, 200 unemployed men made a highly publicized march from Jarrow to London in a bid to show the plight of the industrial poor. Although much romanticized by the Left, the
Jarrow Crusade
marked a deep split in the Labour Party and resulted in no government action.
[167]
Unemployment remained high until the war absorbed all the job seekers.

Vivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War made Britain and its leaders strongly inclined to pacifism in the interwar era. The challenge came from dictators, first
Benito Mussolini
of Italy, then
Adolf Hitler
of a much more powerful
Nazi Germany
. The
League of Nations
proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to "appease" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the
Munich Agreement
of 1938.
[168]
Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain
dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with
Joseph Stalin
to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.

. During the quiet period of "

The smashing German victory in Spring 1940 was due entirely to "superior combat doctrine. Realistic training, imaginative battlefield leadership, and unparalleled initiative from generals down to sergeants."
[170]
The British with the thinnest of margins
rescued its main army from
Dunkirk (as well as many French soldiers), leaving all their equipment and war supplies behind.
Winston Churchill
came to power, promising to fight the Germans to the very end. The Germans threatened an invasion—which the Royal Navy was prepared to repel. First the Germans tried to achieve air supremacy but were defeated by the Royal Air Force in the
Battle of Britain
in late summer 1940.
Japan
declared war in December 1941, and quickly seized Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma, and threatened Australia and India. Britain formed an alliance with the Soviet Union (starting in 1941) and very close ties to the United States (starting in 1940). The war was very expensive. It was paid for by high taxes, by selling off assets, and by accepting large amounts of
Lend Lease
from the U.S. and Canada. The US gave $30 billion in munitions; Canada also gave aid. (The American and Canadian aid did not have to be repaid, but there were also American loans that were repaid.)
[171]
Britain's total mobilisation during this period proved to be successful in winning the war, by maintaining strong support from public opinion. The war was a "people's war" that enlarged democratic aspirations and produced promises of a postwar welfare state.
[172]
The media called it a "people's war"—a term that caught on and signified the popular demand for planning and an expanded welfare state.
[173]
The Royal family played major symbolic roles in the war. They refused to leave London during the
Blitz
and were indefatigable in visiting troops, munition factories, dockyards, and hospitals all over the country. All social classes appreciated how the royals shared the hopes, fears and hardships of the people.
[174]
Mobilisation of women
[
edit
]
Auxiliary Territorial Service
women in York
Historians credit Britain with a highly successful record of mobilising the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.
[175]
Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.
[176]
Women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways the government over-responded, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment became clear,
sacrificing cats and dogs
to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent need to keep rats and mice under control.
[177]
The British relied successfully on voluntarism. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasised, in large part to free shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the area under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000 acres (from about 50,000 to 75,000 km
2
), and the farm labour force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the
Women's Land Army
.
[178]
Welfare state
[
edit
]
Main article:
Beveridge Report
The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals and school lunches, as well as egalitarian spirit, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. It was supported by the coalition government and all major parties. Welfare conditions, especially regarding food, improved during the war as the government imposed rationing and subsidized food prices. Conditions for housing, however, worsened with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply.
Equality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.
[179]
People demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices
[180]
The goal was operationalized in a famous report by
William Beveridge
. It recommended that the various income maintenance services that had grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired. A full-scale National Health Service would provide free medical care for everyone. All the major parties endorsed the principles and they were largely put into effect when peace returned.

for

and the

. They were elected on a manifesto of greater
social justice
with left-wing policies such as the creation of a

and
nationalisation
of several major industries. Britain faced a severe financial crisis, and responded by reducing her international responsibilities and by sharing the hardships of an "age of austerity".

Nationalisation

Labour Party experts went into the files to find the detailed plans for nationalisation. To their surprise
[

, there were no plans. The leaders decided to act fast to keep up the momentum of the 1945 electoral landslide. They started with the
Bank of England
, civil aviation, coal, and
Cable & Wireless
. Then came railways, canals, road haulage and trucking, electricity, and gas. Finally came iron and steel, which was a special case because it was a manufacturing industry. Altogether, about one fifth of the economy was nationalised. Labour dropped its plans to nationalise farmlands. The procedure used was developed by
Herbert Morrison
, who as
Lord President of the Council
chaired the Committee on the Socialization of Industries.

He followed the model that had already been used to establish public corporations such as the
BBC
(1927). In exchange for the shares, the owners of the companies were given government bonds paying low rates of interest, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, but they were now effectively civil servants working for the government.
[186]
For the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a way to consolidate economic planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure. There was no money for modernisation, although the
Marshall Plan
, operated separately by American planners, did force many British businesses to adopt modern managerial techniques. Hardline socialists were disappointed, as the nationalised industries seemed identical to the old private corporations, and national planning was made virtually impossible by the government's financial constraints. Socialism was in place, but it did not seem to make a major difference. Rank-and-file workers had long been motivated to support Labour by tales of the mistreatment of workers by foremen and the management. The foremen and the managers were the same people as before, with much the same power over the workplace. There was no worker control of industry. The unions resisted government efforts to set wages. By the time of the general elections in 1950 and 1951, Labour seldom boasted about nationalisation of industry. Instead it was the Conservatives who decried the inefficiency and mismanagement, and promised to reverse the takeover of steel and trucking.
[186]
Prosperity of the postwar years
[
edit
]
As the country headed into the 1950s, rebuilding continued and a number of immigrants from the remaining
British Empire
, mostly the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent, were invited to help the rebuilding effort. As the 1950s wore on, Britain lost its place as a
superpower
and could no longer maintain its large
Empire
. This led to decolonisation, and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970. Events such as the
Suez Crisis
showed that the UK's status had fallen in the world. The 1950s and 1960s were, however, relatively prosperous times after the Second World War, and saw the beginning of a modernisation of the UK, with the construction of its first
motorways
for example, and also during the 1960s a great cultural movement began which expanded across the world. Unemployment was relatively low during this period and the standard of living continued to rise with more new private and council housing developments taking place and the number of slum properties diminishing.
The postwar period also witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living,
[187]
[188]
as characterised by a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.
[189]
Earnings for men in industry rose by 95% between 1951 and 1964, while during that same period the official workweek was reduced and five reductions in income tax were made.
[190]
Those in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. As summed up by
R. J. Unstead
,
Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and\ the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.
[158]
In 1950, the UK standard of living was higher than in any EEC country apart from Belgium. It was 50% higher than the West German standard of living, and twice as high as the Italian standard of living. By the earlier Seventies, however, the UK standard of living was lower than all EEC countries apart from Italy (which, according to one calculation, was roughly equal to Britain). In 1951, the average weekly earnings of men over the age of 21 stood at £8 6s 0d, and nearly doubled a decade later to £15 7s 0d. By 1966, average weekly earnings stood at £20 6s 0d.
[191]
Between 1964 and 1968, the percentage of households with a television set rose from 80.5% to 85.5%, a washing machine from 54% to 63%, a refrigerator from 35% to 55%, a car from 38% to 49%, a telephone from 21.5% to 28%, and central heating from 13% to 23%.
[192]
Between 1951 and 1963, wages rose by 72% while prices rose by 45%, enabling people to afford more consumer goods than ever before.
[193]
Between 1955 and 1967, the average earnings of weekly-paid workers increased by 96% and those of salaried workers by 95%, while prices rose by about 45% in the same period.
[194]
The rising affluence of the Fifties and Sixties was underpinned by sustained full employment and a dramatic rise in workers' wages. In 1950, the average weekly wage stood at £6.8s, compared with £11.2s.6d in 1959. As a result of wage rises,
consumer spending
also increased by about 20% during this same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, food rations were lifted in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.
[195]
As noted by Harriet Wilson,
National wealth has grown considerably, and although the shareout of this among the social classes has remained substantially of the same proportions, it has meant a considerable rise in the standard of living of all classes. It is estimated that in Britain at the turn of the century average earnings in industry sufficed merely to meet the essential needs of a two-child family, today average earnings allow the industrial wage-earner to spend a third of his income on things other than basic needs.
[196]
The significant real wage increases in the 1950s and 1960s contributed to a rapid increase in working-class consumerism, with British consumer spending rising by 45% between 1952 and 1964.
[197]
In addition, entitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.
[198]
For the young and unattached, there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959,
Queen
magazine declared that "Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living." Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan
claimed that "the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor." Levels of disposable income rose steadily,
[199]
with the spending power of the average family rising by 50% between 1951 and 1979, and by the end of the Seventies, 6 out of 10 families had come to own a car.
[200]
As noted by
Martin Pugh
,
Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of £8 a week in 1951 to £15 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.
[201]
By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, 45% a washing machine, and 30% a refrigerator. In addition, as noted by John Burnett,
What was equally striking was that ownership of such things had spread down the social scale and the gap between professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed.
A study of a slum area in Leeds (which was due for demolition) found that 74% of the households had a television, 41% a vacuum, and 38% a washing machine. In another slum area, St Mary's in Oldham (where in 1970 few of the houses had fixed baths or a hot water supply and half shared outside toilets), 67% of the houses were rated as comfortably furnished and a further 24% furnished luxuriously, with smart modern furniture, deep pile carpeting, and decorations.
The provision of household amenities steadily improved during the second half of the twentieth century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.
[202]
Between 1950 and 1970, however, Britain was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population (although Britain remained high in terms of bathrooms and lavatories per 100 people). Although the British standard of living was increasing, the standard of living in other countries increased faster.
[203]
According to a 1968 study by Anthony Sampson, British workers:
In ten years, from having had a much higher standard of living than the continent, they have slipped right back. Taking the national income per head (a rough yardstick), the British by 1967 had sunk to eighth place among OECD countries, with an annual income of $1,910 compared with $2,010 for Germany, $2,060 for France and $2,480 for Switzerland: and Britain's falling position already shows itself in the lower proportion of new cars and new houses (though still leading with TV sets and washing machines)."
[204]
In 1976, UK wages were amongst the lowest in Western Europe, being half of West German rates and two-thirds of Italian rates.
[205]
In addition, while educational opportunities for working-class people had widened significantly since the end of the Second World War, a number of developed countries came to overtake Britain in some educational indicators. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan stayed in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.
[206]
In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in the United Kingdom.
[207]
There also remained gaps between manual and non-manual workers in areas such as fringe benefits and wage levels. In April 1978, for instance, male full-time manual workers aged 21 and above averaged a gross weekly wage of £80.70, while the equivalent for male white collar workers stood at £100.70.

British
decolonisation in Africa
Britain's control over its Empire loosened during the interwar period.
Nationalism
strengthened in other parts of the empire, particularly in India and in
Egypt
.
Between 1867 and 1910, the UK had granted Australia, Canada, and New Zealand "Dominion" status (near complete autonomy within the Empire). They became charter members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (known as the
Commonwealth of Nations
since 1949), an informal but close-knit association that succeeded the British Empire. Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the remainder of the British Empire was almost completely dismantled. Today, most of Britain's former colonies belong to the Commonwealth, almost all of them as independent members. There are, however, 13 former British colonies, including
Bermuda
,
Gibraltar
, the
Falkland Islands
, and others, which have elected to continue rule by London and are known as
British Overseas Territories
.

The Troubles
A mural in Ulster supporting for the

In the 1960s, moderate unionist Prime Minister of Northern Ireland
Terence O'Neill
tried to reform the system and give a greater voice to Catholics who comprised 40% of the population of Northern Ireland. His goals were blocked by militant Protestants led by the Rev.
Ian Paisley
.
[209]
The increasing pressures from nationalists for reform and from unionists to resist reform led to the appearance of the civil rights movement under figures like
John Hume
,
Austin Currie
and others. Clashes escalated out of control as the army could barely contain the
Provisional Irish Republican Army
(IRA) and the
Ulster Defence Association
. British leaders feared their withdrawal would give a "Doomsday Scenario", with widespread communal strife, followed by the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. London shut down Northern Ireland's parliament and began direct rule. By the 1990s, the failure of the IRA campaign to win mass public support or achieve its aim of a British withdrawal led to negotiations that in 1998 produced the '
Good Friday Agreement
'. It won popular support and largely ended the Troubles.

The economy in the late 20th century
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of the United Kingdom (1945-present)
After the relative prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s, the UK experienced extreme industrial strife and
stagflation
through the 1970s following a global economic downturn; Labour had returned to government in
1964
under
Harold Wilson
to end 13 years of Conservative rule. The Conservatives were
restored to government
in 1970 under
Edward Heath
, who failed to halt the country's economic decline and was ousted in
1974
as Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson. The economic crisis deepened following Wilson's return and things fared little better under his successor
James Callaghan
.
A strict modernisation of its economy began under the controversial Conservative leader
Margaret Thatcher
following her
election as prime minister
in 1979, which saw a time of record
unemployment
as
deindustrialisation
saw the end of much of the country's
manufacturing
industries, but also
a time of economic boom
as stock markets became liberalised and state-owned industries were
privatised
. Her rise to power was seen as the symbolic end of the time in which the British economy had become the "sick man" of western Europe.
[211]
Inflation also fell during this period and trade union power was reduced.
Miners' strike rally in London, 1984
However the
miners' strike of 1984-1985
sparked the end of most of the UK's
coal
mining. The exploitation of
North Sea
gas
and oil brought in substantial tax and export revenues to aid the new economic boom. This was also the time that the IRA took the issue of
Northern Ireland
to Great Britain, maintaining a prolonged bombing campaign on the British mainland.
After the economic boom of the 1980s a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992 following the economic chaos of
Black Wednesday
under government of
John Major
, who had succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. However the rest of the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over 16 years and was greatly expanded under the
New Labour
government of
Tony Blair
following his landslide election victory in 1997, with a rejuvenated party having abandoned its commitment to policies including nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms.
From 1964 up until 1996, income per head had doubled, while ownership of various household goods had significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer.
[212]
In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties which lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders, and 47% had microwave ovens. Holiday entitlements had also become more generous. In 1990, nine out of ten full-time manual workers were entitled to more than four weeks of paid holiday a year, while twenty years previously only two-thirds had been allowed three weeks or more.
[213]
The postwar period also witnessed significant improvements in housing conditions. In 1960, 14% of British households had no inside toilet, while in 1967 22% of all homes had no basic hot water supply. By the 1990s, most homes had these amenities together with central heating.

From 1996-1997 to 2006-2007, real median household income increased by 20% while real mean household incomes increased by 23%. There has also been a shift towards a service-based economy in the years following the end of the Second World War, with 11% of working people employed in manufacturing in 2006, compared with 25% in 1971.
Common Market (EEC), then EU, membership
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities
and
1973 enlargement of the European Communities
Britain's wish to join the Common Market (as the
European Economic Community
was known in Britain) was first expressed in July 1961 by the Macmillan government. It was vetoed in 1963 by
French President
Charles de Gaulle
.
[214]
After initially hesitating over the issue,
Harold Wilson
's Labour Government lodged the UK's second application (in May 1967) to join the Community. Like the first, though, it was vetoed by de Gaulle.
[215]
In 1973, with DeGaulle gone, Conservative Prime Minister Heath negotiated terms for admission and Britain finally joined the Community. In opposition the Labour Party was deeply divided, though its Leader, Harold Wilson, remained in favour. In the 1974 General Election the Labour Party manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history. In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of "collective responsibility", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government (and the Conservative opposition) were free to present their views on either side of the question. A
referendum
was duly held on 5 June 1975, and the proposition to continue membership was passed with a substantial majority.
[216]
The
Single European Act
(SEA) was the first major revision of the 1957
Treaty of Rome
. In 1987, the Conservative government under
Margaret Thatcher
enacted it
into UK law.
[217]
The
Maastricht Treaty
transformed the European Community into the
European Union
. In 1992, the Conservative government under
John Major
ratified it, against the opposition of his backbench
Maastricht Rebels
.
[217]
The
Treaty of Lisbon
introduced many changes to the treaties of the Union. Prominent changes included more
qualified majority voting
in the
Council of Ministers
, increased involvement of the
European Parliament
in the legislative process through extended
codecision
with the Council of Ministers, eliminating the
pillar system
and the creation of a
President of the European Council
with a term of two and a half years and a
High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy
to present a united position on EU policies. The Treaty of Lisbon will also make the Union's human rights charter, the
Charter of Fundamental Rights
, legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty also leads to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the
Council of the European Union
from 8.4% to 12.4%. In July 2008, the Labour government under
Gordon Brown
approved the treaty and the Queen ratified it.

On 11 September 1997, (on the 700th anniversary of the Scottish victory over the English at the

), a
referendum
was held on establishing a devolved
Scottish Parliament
. This resulted in an overwhelming 'yes' vote both to establishing the parliament and granting it limited tax varying powers. One week later, a
referendum
in Wales on establishing a
Welsh Assembly
was also approved but with a very narrow majority. The first elections were held, and these bodies began to operate in 1999. The creation of these bodies has widened the differences between the
Countries of the United Kingdom
, especially in areas like
healthcare
.
[219]
[220]
It has also brought to the fore the so-called
West Lothian question
which is a complaint that devolution for Scotland and Wales but not England has created a situation where Scottish and Welsh MPs in the UK Parliament can, in principle, vote on internal matters affecting England alone whereas English MPs have no say in similar matters affecting Scotland and Wales.

Forty-six thousand British troops, one-third of the total strength of the Army's land forces, were deployed to assist with the invasion of Iraq and thereafter British armed forces were responsible for security in southern Iraq.

Nationalist governments in Scotland
[
edit
]
Following the
2007 Scottish Parliament election
, the pro-independence
Scottish National Party
(SNP) won their first every victory. They formed a
minority government
with plans to hold a referendum before 2011 to seek a mandate "to negotiate with the Government of the United Kingdom to achieve
independence for Scotland
."
[224]
Unionist parties responded by establishing the
Calman Commission
to examine further
devolution
of powers,
[225]
a position that had the support of the Prime Minister.
[226]
Responding to the findings of the review, the UK government issued a white paper in November 2009, on new powers that would be devolved to the
Scottish Government
, notably on how it can raise tax and carry out capital borrowing, and the running of
Scottish Parliament elections
.
[227]
The proposal was criticised by the UK parliament opposition parties for not proposing to implement any changes before the
next general election
. Scottish Constitution Minister
Michael Russell
criticised the white paper, calling it "flimsy" and stating that their proposed
Referendum (Scotland) Bill, 2010
, whose own white paper was to be published five days later, would be "more substantial".
[227]
According to
The Independent
, the Calman Review white paper proposals fall short of what would normally be seen as requiring a referendum.
[228]
These proposals would ultimately form the basis of the
Scotland Act 2012
.
The
2011 election
saw a decisive victory for the SNP which was able to form a majority government intent on delivering a referendum on independence.
[229]
Within hours of the victory, Prime Minister David Cameron guaranteed that the UK government would not put any legal or political obstacles in the way of such a referendum.

Better Together
campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the
Yes Scotland
campaign, together with the
Scottish Green Party
and the
Scottish Socialist Party
. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued
'The Vow'
, a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom.
First minister Alex Salmond resigned shortly after the defeat, succeeded by
Nicola Sturgeon
. Advocating for
a second referendum
, she would lead the SNP to victory in the

The 2008 economic crisis
[
edit
]
In the wake of the global
economic crisis of 2008
, the United Kingdom economy contracted, experiencing negative economic growth throughout 2009. The announcement in November 2008 that the economy had shrunk for the first time since late 1992 brought an end to 16 years of continuous economic growth. Causes included an end to the easy credit of the preceding years, reduction in consumption and substantial depreciation of sterling (which fell 25% against the euro between January 2008 and January 2009),
[231]
leading to increased import costs, notably of oil.
On 8 October 2008, the
British Government
announced a
bank rescue package
of around £500 billion
[232]
($850 billion at the time). The plan comprised three parts.: £200 billion to be made available to the banks in the
Bank of England
's Special Liquidity Scheme; the Government was to increase the banks' market capitalization, through the Bank Recapitalization Fund, with an initial £25 billion and another £25 billion to be provided if needed; and the Government was to temporarily underwrite any eligible lending between British banks up to around £250 billion. With the UK officially coming out of recession in the fourth quarter of 2009—ending six consecutive quarters of economic decline—the Bank of England decided against further
quantitative easing
.
[233]
The 2010 coalition government
[

]
The
United Kingdom General Election
of 6 May 2010 resulted in the first
hung parliament
since 1974, with the Conservative Party winning the largest number of seats, but falling short of the 326 seats required for an overall majority. Following this, the Conservatives and the
Liberal Democrats
agreed to form the first
coalition government
for the UK since the end of the Second World War, with
David Cameron
becoming Prime Minister and
Nick Clegg
Deputy Prime Minister.
[234]
Under the coalition government,
British military aircraft
participated in the UN-mandated
intervention
in the
2011 Libyan civil war
, flying a total of 3,000 air
sorties
against forces loyal to the Libyan dictator
Muammar Gaddafi
between March and October 2011.
[235]
[236]
2011 also saw England suffer
unprecedented rioting
in its major cities in early August, killing five people and causing over £200 million worth of property damage.
[237]
In late October 2011, the
prime ministers
of the
Commonwealth realms
voted to grant gender equality in the
royal succession
, ending the male-preference
primogeniture
that was mandated by the
Act of Settlement 1701
.
[238]
The amendment, once enacted, will also end the ban on the monarch marrying a Catholic.
[239]
2015 election
[
edit
]
The
2015 election
was held on 7 May 2015 with pre-election polls all predicting a close race and a hung parliament. The surprising result on the night was a clear victory by the Conservative Party: with 37% of the popular vote, they won a narrow overall majority in parliament with 331 of the 650 seats.
The other most significant result of the election was the
Scottish National Party
winning all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. This had been widely forecast as opinion polls had recorded a surge in support for the SNP following the 2014 independence referendum, and SNP party membership had more than quadrupled from 25,000 to over 100,000, meaning that 1 in every 50 of the population of Scotland was a party member.
[240]
Labour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and losing 40 of its 41 seats in Scotland. The
Liberal Democrats
lost 49 of their 57 seats, as they were punished for their decision to form a coalition with the conservatives in 2010. The
UK Independence Party
(UKIP), rallying voters against the European Union and against uncontrolled immigration, secured 13% of the vote and came second in over 115 races, but won only one seat in parliament.
[241]
Cameron had a mandate for his austerity policies to shrink the size of government, and a challenge in dealing with Scotland.
[242]
Likewise the Green Party of England and Wales saw a rise in support but retained just its one seat.

eurosceptics
. Debates and campaigns by parties supporting both "Remain" (

succeeding him as Prime Minister.
The UK remained a member of the EU for the time being, but invoked Article 50 of the
Lisbon Treaty
on 29 March 2017. This started negotiations on a withdrawal agreement that will last no more than two years (unless the Council and the UK agree to extend the negotiation period), before an exit from the European Union (
Brexit
) intended on 29 March 2019 but later extended to currently 31 October 2019.
[244]
The longer-term implications of the referendum vote remain uncertain, with politicians and commentators suggesting various outcomes.
[245]
[246]
The debate on Brexit grew heated. During the 2016 campaign on the referendum,
Boris Johnson
became a leading proponent of
Vote Leave
, stating, "The EU is, I'm afraid a job-destroying engine. You can see it all across southern Europe, you can see it, alas, in our country". A victory for Brexit, he argued, would be "independence day" for Britain if it leaves the European Union.
[247]
By 2019, Johnson was Prime Minister and pushed hard for an exit on 31 October 2019. The opponents warned of bedlam. Political commentator
Jonathan Freedland
argued in late summer 2019 that the Britain of 2019 is, "in the grip of a populism that is trampling on the norms and constraints of liberal democracy, that is contemplating a collective act of self-harm without precedent, that is bracing itself for disruption, shortages, even civil unrest unknown in peacetime. This is not the consequence of unavoidable war or an unforeseen natural disaster, but is entirely of the country's own making."

Main article:
History of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom
Though later reporting indicated that there may have been some cases dating from late 2019,
[249]
[250]
COVID-19 was confirmed to be spreading in the UK by the end of January 2020
[251]
with the first confirmed deaths in March.
[252]
The country was initially relatively slow in implementing restrictions.
[253]
[254]
[255]
Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over 1000 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 entered the UK in early 2020 from international travellers, mostly from
outbreaks elsewhere in Europe
, leading to numerous clusters that overwhelmed contact tracing efforts.
[256]
A legally enforced Stay at Home Order, or lockdown, was introduced on 23 March.
[257]
Restrictions were steadily eased across the UK in late spring and early summer that year.
[258]
[259]
[260]
[261]
[262]
[263]
The UK's epidemic in early 2020 was at the time one of the largest and deadliest worldwide.
[256]
Sign encouraging the public to

and avoid unessential travel in
Leicester
during January 2021
By the Autumn, COVID-19 cases were again rising.
[264]
This led to the creation of new regulations along with the introduction of the concept of a local lockdown, a variance in restrictions in a more specific geographic location than the four nations of the UK.
[265]
[266]
[267]
[268]
[269]
[270]
Lockdowns took place in Wales, England and Northern Ireland later that season.
[271]
[272]
[273]
A
new variant of the virus
is thought to have originated in
Kent
around September 2020.
[274]
[275]
Once restrictions were lifted, the novel variant rapidly spread across the UK.
[276]
Its increased transmissibility contributed to a continued increase in daily infections.
[277]
The NHS had come under severe strain by late December.
[278]
[279]
[280]
[281]
[282]
This led to a tightening of restrictions across the UK.
[283]
[284]
[285]
[286]
The first COVID-19 vaccine was approved and began its rollout in the UK in early December,
[287]
[288]
15 million vaccine doses had been given to predominantly those most vulnerable to the virus by mid-February.
[289]
6 months later more than 75% of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
[290]
Restrictions began to ease from late February onwards and almost all had ended in Great Britain by August.
[291]
[292]
[293]
[294]
A third wave of daily infections began in July 2021 due to the arrival and rapid spread of the highly transmissible
SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant
.
[295]
However, mass vaccination continued to keep deaths and hospitalisations at much lower levels than in previous waves.
[296]
[297]
During the ongoing third COVID wave, in the light of highly transmissible
Omicron variant
, the U.K. was also the acclaim of a new hybrid strain, Deltacron variant, which pre-dominates the country until April 2022 as ahead of
endemic phase
alongside
Ireland
,
Finland
,
Cyprus
,
Slovenia
,
Croatia
, and among others.

Starting in November 2021, a
political scandal
emerged about parties and other gatherings of
government
and
Conservative Party
staff held during the
COVID-19 pandemic
in 2020 and 2021, when
public health restrictions
prohibited most gatherings. While several
lockdowns in the country
were in place, gatherings took place at
10 Downing Street
,
its garden
, and other government buildings. Reports of events attracted media attention, public backlash and political controversy. In late January 2022, twelve gatherings came under investigation by the
Metropolitan Police
, including at least three attended by
Boris Johnson
, the
Prime Minister
. The police issued 126
fixed penalty notices
(FPNs) to 83 individuals whom the police found had committed offences under COVID-19 regulations, including one each to Johnson, his wife
Carrie Johnson
, and
Rishi Sunak
, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
, who all apologised and paid the penalties. The scandal damaged Johnson with various polls throughout late 2021 and early 2022 suggested that a majority of voters wanted Johnson to resign as Prime Minister over the controversy.
[298]
[299]
[300]
After Johnson apologised for the 20 May 2020 gathering, one poll indicated that 68% of the public considered his apology not to have been sincere.
[301]
By 14 January 2022, YouGov polling found that 72% of the British public held an unfavourable view of Johnson, a record low for his tenure and surpassing the lowest popularity of Theresa May during her premiership.
[302]
Following the reporting of further gatherings in January 2022, the Conservatives fell further in the polls, with Labour having a lead of around 10 points.
[303]
Polling by
Ipsos MORI
in January 2022 found that "lack of faith in politicians and politics" was cited as a major problem facing the country by 25% of the public, the highest recorded since 2016 and "likely related" to the revelations of lockdown parties.
[304]
July 2022 United Kingdom Government Crisis
[

Main article:
July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis
During 2022 more scandals emerged, and in early July 2022, 62 of the United Kingdom's 179
government ministers
,
parliamentary private secretaries
,
trade envoys
, and
party vice-chairmen
resigned from their positions in the
second Johnson ministry
.
[305]
And what was considered the "last straw" for the Prime Minister was the
Chris Pincher scandal
, the scandal arose after it was revealed that Johnson had promoted his
Deputy Chief Government Whip
Chris Pincher
, who was publicly facing multiple allegations of
sexual assault
, to the position despite knowing of the allegations beforehand.
[306]
[307]
And on the 7 July,
Boris Johnson
's resigned.
[308]
Foreign Secretary
Liz Truss
was
elected as his successor
to the
Conservative Party leadership
on the 5 September defeating former
Chancellor
Rishi Sunak
with 81,326 (57.4%) against Sunak's 60,399 (42.6%).
[309]
October 2022 United Kingdom Government Crisis
[
edit
]
Main articles:
September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget
and
October 2022 United Kingdom government crisis
Liz Truss's premiership would be short lived, as in September and October 2022,
Liz Truss
and her Conservative government faced a credibility crisis. The crisis began following the
September 2022 United Kingdom mini-budget
, which was received negatively by the world
financial markets
. It ultimately led to the dismissal of the
chancellor of the Exchequer
,
Kwasi Kwarteng
, on 14 October, and his replacement by
Jeremy Hunt
.
[310]
In the following days Truss came under increasing pressure to reverse further elements of the mini-budget to satisfy the markets, and five Conservative
members of parliament
had called for her resignation by 17 October.
On 19 October
Suella Braverman
, the
home secretary
, resigned over a technical breach of the
Ministerial Code
following a disagreement with Truss over immigration reform. Braverman's resignation letter was highly critical of Truss.
[311]
That evening MPs voted on a
Labour Party
motion
to create time to debate a ban on
fracking in the United Kingdom
, which was opposed by the government. The vote caused confusion among Conservative MPs, who were not clear whether or not it was being treated as a
confidence vote
. The confusion was compounded by speculation that the
Chief Whip
and Deputy Chief Whip had resigned, and by allegations that some Conservative MPs had been manhandled in the voting lobby.
On 20 October, Truss resigned but stated she would remain in office until the Conservative Party had chosen her successor.
[312]
Truss was in office for 50 days before her resignation, and her departure made her term
the shortest overall of any prime minister in UK history
, beating
George Canning
who died in office after 119 days.
[313]
The resulting
leadership election
had two candidates:
Rishi Sunak
and
Leader of the House of Commons
Penny Mordaunt
who ran against Truss and Sunak in the previous leadership election. There was speculation that former Prime Minister
Boris Johnson
would run,
[314]
[315]
however on 23 October, he announced he was not participating in the election.
[316]
[317]
On 24 October, minutes before the result was announced, Mordaunt announced her withdrawal from the election, leaving Sunak as the sole candidate.
[318]
He was appointed prime minister on 25 October.

Biography
[
edit
]

Xinxiang
,
Henan
. He won two gold medals in the
1996 Summer Olympics
, the men's singles and the men's doubles (with Kong Linghui), he won the men's singles in the 1996 World Cup, the World Doubles Championships in 1997 and 1999 with doubles partner
Kong Linghui
, and the
1999 World Singles Championships
in Eindhoven. He was a member of the winning Chinese team in both the 1995 and 1997 World Table Tennis Championships.
Liu retired after the 2001 season and was appointed as the head coach of the China's National Men's Team at the age of 27. As the head coach of the Chinese Men's National Table Tennis Team he is the most successful coach in history with a team gold medal at the
2008 Summer Olympics
in addition to the medal sweep by
Ma Lin
,
Wang Hao
, and
Wang Liqin
. At the
2012 Summer Olympics
the team won gold and
Zhang Jike
and Wang Hao won gold and silver medals respectively in the men's singles.
[1]
At the 2016 Summer Olympics the team again won gold and
Ma Long
and Zhang Jike won the gold and silver medals in the men's singles.
[2]

[3]
[4]
2021
[
edit
]
In June, Liu stated that unlike in previous Olympic games, he did not want to place pressure on the Chinese players and coaches to sweep all the gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics.
[5]
Equipment
[
edit
]
His playing style is based on the use of short pimple-out rubber and he uses a penholder grip. He is the forerunner of the backhand reverse topspin. His blade is
Stiga
Clipper, his forehand rubber is Stiga Clippa and his reverse backhand rubber is Stiga Mendo Energy.
During his prime (1996-1999) Liu played with TSP Spinpips on his forehand and Mark V on his backhand, yet still on the Stiga Clipper blade. The Spinpip rubbers was banned in the late 2000 and their counterpart Spinpip Md the year after. Both times because of the aspect ratio (ratio of pips height to width) and its structure of the pip and the arrangement of the pips that made the rubber extremely spinny and unpredictable; and therefore judged to be too advantageous. It is therefore uncertain if Liu actually ever played with Stiga rubbers in competition.
Family
[

Liu Guoliang's older brother,
Liu Guodong
, was the head coach of the Indonesia table tennis national team.

Nationality
Spanish
Occupation
Nobleman
Enrique Enríquez the Elder
(c. 1246 - before 28 February 1323) was a nobleman of Castile, natural son of the
Infante Henry of Castile
.
He was Lord of
La Puebla de los Infantes
. His son,
Enrique Enríquez the Younger
, had a distinguished career serving kings
Alfonso XI of Castile
and
Peter of Castile
.
Enrique Enríquez was the natural son of the Infante Henry of Castile and Lady Mayor Rodriguez Pecha.
His father was son of King
Ferdinand III of Castile
by his first wife
Beatrice of Swabia
.
His mother was the daughter of Esteban Pérez Pecha, Lord of
San Román de Hornija
and governor of
Zamora
, and Mayor Rodriguez de Balboa.
Mayor Rodriguez de Balboa was daughter of Pedro Rodríguez de Balboa, chamberlain of the Infante Henry of Castile.
The exact date of birth of Enrique Enríquez is not known.
Some authors say he was born in
Andalusia
around 1246.
[

]
Others think he was born in Italy during one of the periods when the Infante Henry was staying there.
[1]
There is some doubt about his paternity, since the Infante Henry did not name him or his mother in his will, despite naming many of his servants.
[1]
On 27 July 1253 his uncle,
Alfonso X of Castile
the Wise, gave Enrique Enríquez the lordship of La Puebla de los Infantes, in the present
province of Seville
.
[2]
Enrique Enríquez married Estefanía Rodríguez de Ceballos, Lady of
Villalba de los Barros
and of Vado de las Estacas.
She was daughter of Rodrigo González de Ceballos, Alcalde Mayor of
Toledo
and
Adelantado Mayor
of
Murcia
, and María Fernández de Caviedes, Lady of
Caviedes
,
Lamadrid
and La Revilla.
[3]
[4]
One son was born of the marriage,
Enrique Enríquez the Younger
.
[5]
In 1307 his wife ceded the lordship of Villalba de los Barros to Enrique Enríquez the Younger, with the consent of Enrique Enríquez.
[6]
The grant was confirmed by a document issued in the city of Valladolid on 12 April 1320 by King
Alfonso XI of Castile
.
[7]
The date when Enrique Enríquez died is unknown, but must have occurred before 28 February 1323. On that date his wife described herself as a widow in a document issued in the city of Seville, when she sold a house.
[8]
Enrique Enríquez the Younger inherited his parents' possessions and served kings
Alfonso XI of Castile
and
Peter of Castile
, who awarded him several grants.
[5]
Several descendants of Enrique Enríquez, including his son, were buried in the monastery of San Francisco in Seville.
[9]
The monastery was looted, desecrated and burned by French troops during the Spanish War of Independence and later demolished in the year 1841.

Nozari worked at
the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC)
.
[3]
Then he became a member of the fourth Majlis and acted as deputy chairman of the energy commission.
[3]
In the fifth Majlis, he was a member of the development commission. He has been a member of the central council of
the Islamic Republic Party
(South Labor Branch). He also served as the member of ad hoc Majlis committee on budget and chairman of assembly of Fars province deputies.
[3]
He was appointed managing director of the NIOC in March 2006.
[3]
He was also appointed deputy oil minister.
[2]
In August 2007, then oil minister
Kazem Vaziri Hamaned
was removed by president
Mahmoud Ahmedinejad
and Nozari was appointed acting oil minister.
[4]
Then Nazari was named as oil minister by Ahmedinejad, and he was in office from 2007 to 2009. His appointment allowed Ahmedinejad to exert much more control over the oil sector in Iran.
[5]
In June 2012, Iran nominated Nozari for the secretary-general of
OPEC
.

Sequence of words formed by specific rules
This article is about a technical term in mathematics and computer science. For any formal type of language usage, see
Literary language
. For studies about natural languages, see
Formal semantics (natural language)
.
Structure of the syntactically well-formed, although nonsensical, English sentence,
"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"
(
historical example
from
Chomsky
1957).
In
logic
,
mathematics
,
computer science
, and
linguistics
, a
formal language
consists of
words
whose
letters
are taken from an
alphabet
and are
well-formed
according to a specific set of rules called a
formal grammar
.
The alphabet of a formal language consists of symbols, letters, or
tokens
that concatenate into
strings
called words.
[1]
Words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called
well-formed words
or
well-formed formulas
. A formal language is often defined by means of a
formal grammar
such as a
regular grammar
or
context-free grammar
, which consists of its
formation rules
.
In computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of
programming languages
and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with meanings or
semantics
. In
computational complexity theory
,
decision problems
are typically defined as formal languages, and
complexity classes
are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be
parsed by machines
with limited computational power. In
logic
and the
foundations of mathematics
, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of
axiomatic systems
, and
mathematical formalism
is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.
The field of
formal language theory
studies primarily the purely
syntactical
aspects of such languages—that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of
natural languages
.
History
This section

(

In the 17th century,
Gottfried Leibniz
imagined and described the
characteristica universalis
, a universal and formal language which utilised
pictographs
. During this period,
Carl Friedrich Gauss
also investigated the problem of
Gauss codes
.
[2]
Gottlob Frege
attempted to realize Leibniz's ideas, through a notational system first outlined in
Begriffsschrift
(1879) and more fully developed in his 2-volume Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893/1903).
[3]
This described a "formal language of pure language."
[4]
In the first half of the 20th century, several developments were made with relevance to formal languages.
Axel Thue
published four papers relating to words and language between 1906 and 1914. The last of these introduced what
Emil Post
later termed 'Thue Systems', and gave an early example of an
undecidable problem
.
[5]
Post would later use this paper as the basis for a 1947 proof "that the word problem for semigroups was recursively insoluble",
[6]
and later devised the
canonical system
for the creation of formal languages.
In 1907,
Leonardo Torres Quevedo
introduced a formal language for the description of mechanical drawings (mechanical devices), in
Vienna
. He published "Sobre un sistema de notaciones y símbolos destinados a facilitar la descripción de las máquinas" ("On a system of notations and symbols intended to facilitate the description of machines").
[7]
Heinz Zemanek
rated it as an equivalent to a
programming language
for the numerical control of machine tools.
[8]
Noam Chomsky
devised an abstract representation of formal and natural languages, known as the
Chomsky hierarchy
.
[9]
In 1959
John Backus
developed the Backus-Naur form to describe the syntax of a high level programming language, following his work in the creation of
FORTRAN
.
[10]
Peter Naur
was the secretary/editor for the ALGOL60 Report in which he used
Backus-Naur form
to describe the Formal part of ALGOL60.
Words over an alphabet
An
alphabet
, in the context of formal languages, can be any
set
; its elements are called
letters
. An alphabet may contain an
infinite
number of elements;
[note 1]
however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and many results apply only to them. It often makes sense to use an
alphabet
in the usual sense of the word, or more generally any finite
character encoding
such as
ASCII
or
Unicode
.
A
word
over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e.,
string
) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet Σ is usually denoted by Σ
*
(using the
Kleene star
). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the
empty word
, which is often denoted by e, ε, λ or even Λ. By
concatenation
one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.
In some applications, especially in
logic
, the alphabet is also known as the
vocabulary
and words are known as
formulas
or
sentences
; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.
Definition
A formal language
L
over an alphabet Σ is a
subset
of Σ
*
, that is, a set of words over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.
In computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with
natural languages
, the adjective "formal" is often omitted as redundant.
While formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept "formal language" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less. In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as
regular languages
or
context-free languages
. The notion of a
formal grammar
may be closer to the intuitive concept of a "language", one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.
Examples
The following rules describe a formal language
L
over the alphabet Σ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, =}:
Every nonempty string that does not contain "+" or "=" and does not start with "0" is in
L
.
The string "0" is in
L
.
A string containing "=" is in
L
if and only if there is exactly one "=", and it separates two valid strings of
L
.
A string containing "+" but not "=" is in
L
if and only if every "+" in the string separates two valid strings of
L
.
No string is in
L
other than those implied by the previous rules.
Under these rules, the string "23+4=555" is in
L
, but the string "=234=+" is not. This formal language expresses
natural numbers
, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their
syntax
), not what they mean (
semantics
). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that "0" means the number zero, "+" means addition, "23+4=555" is false, etc.
Constructions
For finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language
L
as just
L
= {a, b, ab, cba}. The
degenerate
case of this construction is the
empty language
, which contains no words at all (
L
=
∅
).
However, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as Σ = {a, b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: "a", "abb", "ababba", "aaababbbbaab", .... Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing
L
= {a, b, ab, cba}. Here are some examples of formal languages:
L
= Σ
*
, the set of
all
words over Σ;
L
= {a}
*
= {a
n
}, where
n
ranges over the natural numbers and "a
n
" means "a" repeated
n
times (this is the set of words consisting only of the symbol "a");
the set of syntactically correct programs in a given programming language (the syntax of which is usually defined by a
context-free grammar
);
the set of inputs upon which a certain
Turing machine
halts; or
the set of maximal strings of
alphanumeric
ASCII
characters on this line, i.e.,
the set {the, set, of, maximal, strings, alphanumeric, ASCII, characters, on, this, line, i, e}.
Language-specification formalisms
Formal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as
those strings generated by some
formal grammar
;
those strings described or matched by a particular
regular expression
;
those strings accepted by some
automaton
, such as a
Turing machine
or
finite-state automaton
;
those strings for which some
decision procedure
(an
algorithm
that asks a sequence of related YES/NO questions) produces the answer YES.
Typical questions asked about such formalisms include:
What is their expressive power? (Can formalism
X
describe every language that formalism
Y
can describe? Can it describe other languages?)
What is their recognizability? (How difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a language described by formalism
X
?)
What is their comparability? (How difficult is it to decide whether two languages, one described in formalism
X
and one in formalism
Y
, or in
X
again, are actually the same language?).
Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is "it cannot be done at all", or "it is extremely expensive" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of
computability theory
and
complexity theory
. Formal languages may be classified in the
Chomsky hierarchy
based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing
automaton
.
Context-free grammars
and
regular grammars
provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of
parsing
, and are widely used in practical applications.
Operations on languages
Certain operations on languages are common. This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.
Examples: suppose
L
1
{\displaystyle L_{1}}
and
L
2
{\displaystyle L_{2}}
are languages over some common alphabet
Σ
{\displaystyle \Sigma }
.
The
concatenation
L
1
⋅
L
2
{\displaystyle L_{1}\cdot L_{2}}
consists of all strings of the form
v
w
{\displaystyle vw}
where
v
{\displaystyle v}
is a string from
L
1
{\displaystyle L_{1}}
and
w
{\displaystyle w}
is a string from
L
2
{\displaystyle L_{2}}
.
The
intersection
L
1
∩
L
2
{\displaystyle L_{1}\cap L_{2}}
of
L
1
{\displaystyle L_{1}}
and
L
2
{\displaystyle L_{2}}
consists of all strings that are contained in both languages
The
complement
¬
L
1
{\displaystyle \neg L_{1}}
of
L
1
{\displaystyle L_{1}}
with respect to
Σ
{\displaystyle \Sigma }
consists of all strings over
Σ
{\displaystyle \Sigma }
that are not in
L
1
{\displaystyle L_{1}}
.
The
Kleene star
: the language consisting of all words that are concatenations of zero or more words in the original language;
Reversal
:
Let
ε
be the empty word, then
ε
R
=
ε
{\displaystyle \varepsilon ^{R}=\varepsilon }
, and
for each non-empty word
w
=
σ
1
⋯
σ
n
{\displaystyle w=\sigma _{1}\cdots \sigma _{n}}
(where
σ
1
,
…
,
σ
n
{\displaystyle \sigma _{1},\ldots ,\sigma _{n}}
are elements of some alphabet), let
w
R
=
σ
n
⋯
σ
1
{\displaystyle w^{R}=\sigma _{n}\cdots \sigma _{1}}
,
then for a formal language
L
{\displaystyle L}
,
L
R
=
{
w
R
∣
w
∈
L
}
{\displaystyle L^{R}=\{w^{R}\mid w\in L\}}
.
String homomorphism
Such
string operations
are used to investigate
closure properties
of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the
context-free languages
are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with
regular languages
, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of
trios
and
abstract families of languages
studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.

Applications
Programming languages
Main articles:
Syntax (programming languages)
and
Compiler-compiler
A compiler usually has two distinct components. A
lexical analyzer
, sometimes generated by a tool like
lex
, identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g.
identifiers
or
keywords
, numeric and string literals, punctuation and operator symbols, which are themselves specified by a simpler formal language, usually by means of
regular expressions
. At the most basic conceptual level, a
parser
, sometimes generated by a
parser generator
like
yacc
, attempts to decide if the source program is syntactically valid, that is if it is well formed with respect to the programming language grammar for which the compiler was built.
Of course, compilers do more than just parse the source code - they usually translate it into some executable format. Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an
abstract syntax tree
. This is used by subsequent stages of the compiler to eventually generate an
executable
containing
machine code
that runs directly on the hardware, or some
intermediate code
that requires a
virtual machine
to execute.
Formal theories, systems, and proofs
Main articles:
Theory (mathematical logic)
and
Formal system
This diagram shows the
syntactic
divisions within a
formal system
.
Strings of symbols
may be broadly divided into nonsense and
well-formed formulas
. The set of well-formed formulas is divided into
theorems
and non-theorems.
In
mathematical logic
, a
formal theory
is a set of
sentences
expressed in a formal language.
A
formal system
(also called a
logical calculus
, or a
logical system
) consists of a formal language together with a
deductive apparatus
(also called a
deductive system
). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of
transformation rules
, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of
axioms
, or have both. A formal system is used to
derive
one expression from one or more other expressions. Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems. Two formal systems
F
S
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {FS}}}
and
F
S
′
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {FS'}}}
may have all the same theorems and yet differ in some significant proof-theoretic way (a formula A may be a syntactic consequence of a formula B in one but not another for instance).
A
formal proof
or
derivation
is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas (which may be interpreted as sentences, or
propositions
) each of which is an axiom or follows from the preceding formulas in the sequence by a
rule of inference
. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. Formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted as true propositions.
Interpretations and models
Main articles:
Formal semantics (logic)
,
Interpretation (logic)
, and
Model theory
Formal languages are entirely syntactic in nature, but may be given
semantics
that give meaning to the elements of the language. For instance, in mathematical
logic
, the set of possible formulas of a particular logic is a formal language, and an
interpretation
assigns a meaning to each of the formulas—usually, a
truth value
.
The study of interpretations of formal languages is called
formal semantics
. In mathematical logic, this is often done in terms of
model theory
. In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within
mathematical structures
, and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a
model
for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.

The
House of Bourbon-Maine
was a legitimate branch of the
House of Bourbon
, being thus part of the
Capetian dynasty
. It was founded in 1672 when
Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine
was
legitimised
by his father, King
Louis XIV of France
.
History and Founder
[
edit
]
Louis-Auguste, founder of the
House of Bourbon-Maine
, was the first-born illegitimate son of
Louis XIV
of France and his mistress,
Madame de Montespan
.
Immediately after his birth in 1670, he was entrusted to the care of
Madame Scarron
, one of his mother's acquaintances, who brought him to a private house on the rue de Vaugirard, close to the Luxembourg Palace, in Paris.  In 1672, the king legitimised him and other younger siblings he had fathered with Mme de Montespan.  At the time of his legitimation,  Louis-Auguste received the title of
duc du Maine
.
In 1692, Louis Auguste married
Anne-Louise-Bénédicte de Bourbon-Condé
, the daughter of
Henry III Jules de Bourbon, prince de Condé
.
The Children of the
duc du Maine
[
edit
]
Louis-Auguste and his wife had seven children, only three of whom lived to adulthood. All died without issue.
Mademoiselle de Dombes
, (11 September 1694 - 15 September 1694);
Louis Constantin de Bourbon,
prince de Dombes
, (
Château de Versailles
, 17 November 1695 - 28 September 1698);

Integrated circuit Video Display Controller
The
RCA CDP1861
was an integrated circuit
Video Display Controller
, released by the
Radio Corporation of America
(RCA) in the mid-1970s as a support chip for the
RCA 1802
microprocessor. The chip cost in 1977 amounted to less than US$20.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
The CDP1861 was manufactured in a low-power
CMOS
technology, came in a 24-pin DIP (
Dual in-line package
), and required a minimum of external components to work. In 1802-based microcomputers, the CDP1861 (for the
NTSC
video format, CDP1864 variant for
PAL
), used the 1802's built-in
DMA
controller to display black and white (monochrome)
bitmapped
graphics on standard TV screens. The CDP1861 was also known as the Pixie graphics system, display, chip, and video generator,
[2]
especially when used with the
COSMAC ELF
microcomputer. Other known chip markings for the 1861 are TA10171, TA10171V1 and a TA10171X, which were early designations for "pre-qualification engineering samples" and "preliminary part numbers", although they have been found in production
RCA Studio II
game consoles and Netronics Elf microcomputers.
[3]
The CDP1861 was also used in the
Telmac 1800
and Oscom Nano microcomputers.
Specifications
[
edit
]
The 1861 chip could display 64
pixels
horizontally and 128 pixels vertically, though by reloading the 1802's R0 DMA (
direct memory access
) register via the required 1802 software controller program and interrupt service routine, the resolution could be reduced to 64×64 or 64×32 to use less memory than the 1024 bytes needed for the highest resolution (with each monochrome pixel occupying one bit) or to display square pixels. A resolution of 64×32 created square pixels and used 256 bytes of memory (2K bits). This was the usual resolution for the
Chip-8
game programming system. Since the video graphics frame buffer was often similar or equal in size to the memory size, it was not unusual to display your program/data on the screen allowing you to watch the computer "think" (i.e. process its data). Programs which ran amok and accidentally overwrote themselves could be spectacular.
The CDP1862 Color Generator Circuit IC, an 1861 companion chip, could be used to generate
limited color
graphics.
Due to the discontinuation of the 1861 and its rarity, in 2004 a fully functional analogue called the Spare Time Gizmos STG1861 was made for use with the newly designed and produced ELF 2000 (Elf2K) computer.
[4]
It is made in the form of a small
printed circuit board
(PCB) with two small
programmable logic devices
, two simple
TTL chips
, and a 24-pin DIP connector for mounting in place of the original chip.

:
Maḥmūd az-Zuʿbī
;‎ 1935 - 21 May 2000) was
Prime Minister of Syria
from 1 November 1987 to 7 March 2000.
Early life
[
edit
]
Al-Zoubi was born into the
Hasanite
Al-Zoubi
clan which is a
Sunni
family in 1935 in
Khirbet Ghazaleh
, a village 75 miles south of
Damascus
in the
Hauran
region.
[1]
[2]
Prime Minister of Syria
[
edit
]
Al-Zoubi was a member of the Ba'ath Party.
[3]
[4]
Under the rule of then President Hafez Assad, Al-Zoubi was appointed Prime Minister in 1987.
[5]
He presided over a ramshackle purportedly socialist governmental and economic system. Military and government officials exercised immense power and continue to do so. Only oil revenues kept the economy going. Even foreign aid programmes struggled to implement under the weight of bureaucratic obduracy.
Ubiquitous regulations including price-control had the effect most observers say of stifling legitimate enterprise. Many officials are forced into corruption to supplement meager salaries. It is said that corruption extended all the way to the top Syria's government.
When President Hafez Assad was showing signs of poor health in the late 1990s, supporters of his son
Bashar Assad
started positioning him to succeed him as President. Hafez was also a major player in these maneuverings. Syria is a republic where there was no direct transfer of power envisaged in the constitution from father to son.
As Hafez Assad grew sick, it became clear both father and son had decided that Al-Zoubi's days were numbered. Tackling corruption is a popular cause among most Syrians, who see the immense wealth created at their expense as a reason why the Syrian economy has struggled to grow. The dragging down of once swaggering officials, with punishments including jail and the confiscation and auction of their illegally obtained assets earned Bashar much kudos in the community.
On 7 March 2000, Al-Zoubi was replaced as prime minister by
Mohammed Mustafa Mero
.
[6]
Currency crisis
[
edit
]
During 1985-2000, Al-Zoubi's administration failed to arrest the 90 per cent fall in the worth of the Syrian Pound from 3 to 47 to the US Dollar.
Downfall and the Airbus deal controversy
[
edit
]
On 10 May 2000, Hafez Assad expelled Al-Zoubi from the
Ba'ath Party
and decided that Al-Zoubi should be prosecuted over a scandal involving the French aircraft manufacturer
Airbus
.
[1]
Al-Zoubi's assets were frozen by the Syrian government.
[6]
Al-Zoubi and several senior ministers were officially accused of receiving illegal commissions of the order of US$124 million in relation to the purchase of six
Airbus 320-200
passenger jets for
Syrian Arab Airlines
in 1996. The indictment alleged that the normal cost of the planes was US$250 million, but the Government paid $374 million and Airbus sent on US$124 million to the senior ministers. Three others involved in the transaction, including the former minister for economic affairs and the former minister for transport were sentenced to prison for ten years.
The French company Airbus denied paying off the Syrian officials. The Syrian government in September 2003 announced its intention of purchasing six more Airbus planes for the government airline. The official finding within Syrian courts that Airbus paid over a hundred million dollars in bribes to their officials is apparently not a factor in deciding whether to continue to do business with them, especially with Boeing aircraft and spare parts being difficult to attain due to unilateral US sanctions.
Personal life
[
edit
]
Al-Zoubi was married and had three sons and a daughter.
[1]
His sons were Miflih, Hammam and Karim Al-Zoubi.
[7]
Death and burial
[
edit
]
Al-Zoubi died on 21 May 2000.
[7]
[8]
Conflicting reports say he died at age 62
[1]
or 65.
[7]
According to a statement from the
Interior Ministry
, carried by the official
Syrian Arab News Agency
, Al-Zoubi shot himself in the head at his home in Dumer outside
Damascus
.
[1]
The statement said Al-Zoubi died by suicide after learning that the Damascus police chief had come to his house to serve a judicial notice to appear before an investigating judge to answer allegations of corruption and other violations "that caused great harm to the national economy."
[1]
[7]
[9]
An Interior Ministry spokesman said "a shot was heard upstairs and that was a shot fired by Zohbi [
sic
] at himself by his own pistol on the second floor of his house where his wife and children were present."
[9]
The spokesman said Al-Zoubi was rushed to the Mowasat hospital in Damascus, where he later died.
[9]
Hospital officials said none of his family accompanied him to the hospital.
[1]
In June 2000, according to
Lara Marlowe
, there were persistent rumours that Al-Zoubi was actually murdered.
[10]
Al-Zoubi was buried at his birthplace in southern
Syria
.
[7]
His funeral service took place in
Deraa province
on 22 May 2000.
[9]
There were no officials at the ceremony.
[9]
Sources said the funeral at
Kirbit Ghazali
, about 100 km south of Damascus, was a simple ceremony limited to his close family members and some of his hometown people.

The
Highland Amateur Cup
is an annual football cup competition run by the Highland Executive branch of the
Scottish Amateur Football Association
. It also covers various offshore islands.
All teams affiliated to Highland Associations are eligible to enter; and so this competition covers one of the largest geographical areas for any district amateur cup competition in the UK.
Currently, the Associations affiliated to the Highland Amateur Cup are:
Caithness AFA
North West Sutherland AFA
Inverness and District FA
West Highland AFA
Lewis & Harris FA
Uist & Barra AFA
Orkney AFA
Shetland FA
clubs are eligible to take part but due to travel distances, have rarely entered the competition.
History
[
edit
]
Pentland United are the most successful club, having won the competition eight times.
Western Isles teams
[
edit
]
The 1984 tournament was the first time a team from the
Western Isles
was allowed to enter, and Ness' cup-run culminated in a 4-1 victory over Bishopmill Villa at
Victoria Park
,
Dingwall
. Ness have won the competition on three other occasions; 1991, 1992 and 1995.
Back, who also compete in the
Lewis and Harris Football League
, won the cup in 2004.
Lochs (2003 and 2005) and Point (1994) are the other
Lewis and Harris Football League
teams to have won the cup, while Stornoway Athletic have been runners-up on two occasions (1990 and 2003). Carloway also finished runners-up in 2014.

On July 28, 1994,
Kenny Rogers
of the
Texas Rangers
pitched the 14th
perfect game
in
Major League Baseball
history, blanking the
California Angels
4-0 at
The Ballpark at Arlington
.
[1]
Needing 98 pitches to complete his masterpiece, Rogers struck out eight batters. He also survived three-ball counts to seven Angel hitters. The perfect game is, as of 2022, the most recent
no-hitter
in Ranger history.
Rogers said he did not think about the perfect game until the ninth inning—and the bid was almost broken up one batter in. Rookie center fielder
Rusty Greer
preserved the bid by making a diving catch of
Rex Hudler
's sinking line drive to right-center leading off the inning.
[2]
Greer also caught
Gary DiSarcina
's fly ball for the game's final out.
Offensively for the Rangers,
Jose Canseco
hit two home runs. One of them came in the third inning and was on the front end of back-to-back homers with
Iván Rodríguez
, Rogers' catcher.
The perfect game came three years to the day after
Dennis Martínez's perfect game
, the last perfect game prior to this one, and made Rogers the third left-hander to pitch a perfect game, joining
Sandy Koufax
in 1965 and
Tom Browning
in 1988. It also came 10 years after the Angels'
Mike Witt
pitched
his perfect game
against the Rangers, that game taking place in The Ballpark's predecessor,
Arlington Stadium
. As of 2022, the Angels and Rangers are the only two teams to record perfect games against each other.
The home plate umpire was minor league fill-in
Ed Bean
, who was working in his 29th Major League game and seventh as home plate umpire. Bean worked only seven more Major League games.

The
English people
are an
ethnic group
and
nation
native to
England
, who speak the
English language
, a
West Germanic
language, and share a common history and culture.
[9]
The English identity began with the
Anglo-Saxons
, when they were known as the
Angelcynn
, meaning race or tribe of the
Angles
. Their
ethnonym
is derived from the Angles, one of the
Germanic peoples
who migrated to
Great Britain
around the 5th century AD.
[10]
The English largely descend from two main historical population groups: the West Germanic tribes, including the Angles,
Saxons
,
Jutes
, and
Frisians
who settled in
Southern Britain
following the withdrawal of the
Romans
, and the
partially Romanised
Celtic Britons
who already lived there.
[11]
[12]
[13]
[14]
Collectively known as the
Anglo-Saxons
, they founded what was to become the
Kingdom of England
by the early 10th century, in response to the invasion and extensive settlement of
Danes
that began in the late 9th century.
[15]
[16]
This was followed by the
Norman Conquest
and limited settlement of
Normans
in England in the later 11th century.
[17]
[18]
[19]
[11]
[20]
Some definitions of English people include, while others exclude, people descended from later migration into England.
[21]
England is the largest and most populous
country
in the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
. In the
Acts of Union 1707
, the
Kingdom of England
and the
Kingdom of Scotland
merged to become the
Kingdom of Great Britain
.
[22]
Over the years,
English customs and identity
have become fairly closely aligned with
British customs and identity
in general. The majority of people living in England are
British citizens
.
English nationality
[
edit
]
England itself has no devolved government. The 1990s witnessed a rise in English self-awareness.
[23]
This is linked to the expressions of national self-awareness of the other British nations of Wales, Scotland and, to some extent, Northern Ireland which take their most solid form in the new
devolved
political arrangements within the United Kingdom -  and the waning of a shared British national identity with the growing distance between the end of the
British Empire
and the present.
[24]
[25]
[26]
Many recent immigrants to England have assumed a solely British identity, while others have developed dual or mixed identities.
[27]
[28]
[29]
[30]
[31]
Use of the word "English" to describe Britons from
ethnic minorities
in England is complicated by most non-white people in England identifying as British rather than English. In their 2004
Annual Population Survey
, the
Office for National Statistics
compared the ethnic identities of British people with their perceived
national identity
. They found that while 58% of
white people
in England described their nationality as "English", non-white people were more likely to describe themselves as "British".
[32]
Relationship to Britishness
[
edit
]
It is unclear how many British people consider themselves English. The words "English" and "British" are often incorrectly used interchangeably, especially outside the UK. In his study of English identity,
Krishan Kumar
describes a common slip of the tongue in which people say "English, I mean British". He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: "Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'". Kumar suggests that although this blurring is a sign of England's dominant position with the UK, it is also "problematic for the English [...] when it comes to conceiving of their national identity. It tells of the difficulty that most English people have of distinguishing themselves, in a collective way, from the other inhabitants of the British Isles".
[33]
In 1965, the historian
A. J. P. Taylor
wrote,
When the
Oxford History of England
was launched a generation ago, "England" was still an all-embracing word. It meant indiscriminately England and Wales; Great Britain; the United Kingdom; and even the British Empire. Foreigners used it as the name of a
Great Power
and indeed continue to do so.
Bonar Law
, by origin a
Scotch Canadian
, was not ashamed to describe himself as "Prime Minister of England" [...] Now terms have become more rigorous. The use of "England" except for a geographic area brings protests, especially from the
Scotch
.
[34]
However, although Taylor believed this blurring effect was dying out, in his book
The Isles: A History
(1999),
Norman Davies
lists numerous examples in history books of "British" still being used to mean "English" and vice versa.
[35]
In December 2010,
Matthew Parris
in
The Spectator
, analysing the use of "English" over "British", argued that English identity, rather than growing, had existed all along but has recently been unmasked from behind a veneer of Britishness.
[36]
Historical and genetic origins
[

Further information:
Genetic history of the British Isles
Replacement of Neolithic farmers by Bell Beaker populations
[
edit
]
English people, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages:
[37]
Mesolithic
hunter-gatherers
, descended from a
Cro-Magnon
population that arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago;
[38]
Neolithic farmers
who migrated from Anatolia during the
Neolithic Revolution
9,000 years ago;
[39]
and Yamnaya
Steppe pastoralists
who expanded into Europe from the Pontic-Caspian steppe in the context of
Indo-European migrations
5,000 years ago.
[37]
Recent genetic studies have suggested that Britain's Neolithic population was largely replaced by a population from North Continental Europe characterised by the
Bell Beaker culture
around 2400 BC, associated with the
Yamnaya
people from the
Pontic-Caspian Steppe
. This population lacked genetic affinity to some other Bell Beaker populations, such as the Iberian Bell Beakers, but appeared to be an offshoot of the
Corded Ware
single grave people, as developed in Western Europe.
[40]
[41]
It is currently unknown whether these Beaker peoples went on to develop Celtic languages in the
British Isles
, or whether later Celtic migrations introduced Celtic languages to Britain.
[42]
The close genetic affinity of these Beaker people to Continental North Europeans means that British and Irish populations cluster genetically very closely with other Northwest European populations, regardless of how much Anglo-Saxon and Viking ancestry was introduced during the 1st millennium.

Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
The
Incipit
to Matthew from the
Book of Lindisfarne
, an Insular masterpiece
The influence of later invasions and migrations on the English population has been debated, as studies that sampled only modern DNA have produced uncertain results and have thus been subject to a large variety of interpretations.
[44]
[45]
[46]
More recently, however, ancient DNA has been used to provide a clearer picture of the genetic effects of these movements of people.
One 2016 study, using Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon era DNA found at grave sites in Cambridgeshire, calculated that ten modern day eastern English samples had 38% Anglo-Saxon ancestry on average, while ten Welsh and Scottish samples each had 30% Anglo-Saxon ancestry, with a large statistical spread in all cases. However, the authors noted that the similarity observed between the various sample groups was likely to be due to more recent internal migration.
[47]
Another 2016 study conducted using evidence from burials found in northern England, found that a significant genetic difference was present in bodies from the Iron Age and the Roman period on the one hand, and the Anglo-Saxon period on the other. Samples from modern-day Wales were found to be similar to those from the Iron Age and Roman burials, while samples from much of modern England, East Anglia in particular, were closer to the Anglo-Saxon-era burial. This was found to demonstrate a "profound impact" from the Anglo-Saxon migrations on the modern English gene pool, though no specific percentages were given in the study.
[13]
A third study combined the ancient data from both of the preceding studies and compared it to a large number of modern samples from across Britain and Ireland. This study found that modern southern, central and eastern English populations were of "a predominantly Anglo-Saxon-like ancestry" while those from northern and southwestern England had a greater degree of indigenous origin.
[48]
A major 2020 study, which used DNA from Viking-era burials in various regions across Europe, found that modern English samples showed nearly equal contributions from a native British "North Atlantic" population and a Danish-like population. While much of the latter signature was attributed to the earlier settlement of the Anglo-Saxons, it was calculated that up to 6% of it could have come from Danish Vikings, with a further 4% contribution from a Norwegian-like source representing the Norwegian Vikings. The study also found an average 18% admixture from a source further south in Europe, which was interpreted as reflecting the legacy of French migration under the Normans.
[49]
A landmark 2022 study titled "The Anglo-Saxon migration and the formation of the early English gene pool", found the English to be of plurality Anglo-Saxon-like ancestry, with heavy native
Celtic Briton
, and newly confirmed medieval French admixture. Significant regional variation was also observed.

A replica of the
Sutton Hoo helmet
The first people to be called "English" were the
Anglo-Saxons
, a group of closely related
Germanic
tribes that began migrating to eastern and southern Great Britain, from southern Denmark and northern Germany, in the 5th century AD, after the
Romans had withdrawn from Britain
. The Anglo-Saxons gave their name to England ("Engla land", meaning "Land of the Angles") and to the English.
The Anglo-Saxons arrived in a land that was already populated by people commonly referred to as the "
Romano-British
"—the descendants of the native Brittonic-speaking population that lived in the area of Britain under Roman rule during the 1st-5th centuries AD. The multi-ethnic nature of the
Roman Empire
meant that small numbers of other peoples may have also been present in England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. There is archaeological evidence, for example, of an early North African presence in a Roman garrison at
Aballava
, now
Burgh-by-Sands
, in Cumbria: a 4th-century inscription says that the Roman military unit "Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum" ("unit of Aurelian Moors") from Mauretania (Morocco) was stationed there.
[51]
Although the Roman Empire incorporated peoples from far and wide, genetic studies suggest the Romans did not significantly mix into the British population.
[52]
Southern Great Britain in AD 600 after the Anglo-Saxon settlement, showing England's division into multiple
petty kingdoms
The exact nature of
the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons
and their relationship with the Romano-British is a matter of debate. The traditional view is that a mass invasion by various Anglo-Saxon tribes largely displaced the indigenous British population in southern and eastern Great Britain (modern-day England with the exception of
Cornwall
). This is supported by the writings of
Gildas
, who gives the only contemporary historical account of the period, and describes the slaughter and starvation of native Britons by invading tribes (
aduentus Saxonum
).
[53]
Furthermore, the English language contains no more than a handful of words borrowed from
Brittonic
sources.
[54]
This view was later re-evaluated by some archaeologists and historians, with a more small-scale migration being posited, possibly based around an elite of male warriors that took over the rule of the country and gradually acculturated the people living there.
[55]
[56]
[57]
Within this theory, two processes leading to Anglo-Saxonisation have been proposed. One is similar to culture changes observed in Russia, North Africa and parts of the Islamic world, where a politically and socially powerful minority culture becomes, over a rather short period, adopted by a settled majority. This process is usually termed "elite dominance".
[58]
The second process is explained through incentives, such as the
Wergild
outlined in the law code of Ine of Wessex which produced an incentive to become Anglo-Saxon or at least English speaking.
[59]
Historian Malcolm Todd writes, "It is much more likely that a large proportion of the British population remained in place and was progressively dominated by a Germanic aristocracy, in some cases marrying into it and leaving Celtic names in the, admittedly very dubious, early lists of Anglo-Saxon dynasties. But how we identify the surviving Britons in areas of predominantly Anglo-Saxon settlement, either archaeologically or linguistically, is still one of the deepest problems of early English history."
[60]
An emerging view is that the degree of population replacement by the Anglo-Saxons, and thus the degree of survival of the Romano-Britons, varied across England, and that as such the overall settlement of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons cannot be described by any one process in particular. Large-scale migration and population shift seems to be most applicable in the cases of eastern regions such as East Anglia and Lincolnshire,
[61]
[62]
[63]
[64]
[65]
while in parts of Northumbria, much of the native population likely remained in place as the incomers took over as elites.
[66]
[67]
In a study of place names in northeastern England and southern Scotland, Bethany Fox found that the migrants settled in large numbers in river valleys, such as those of the Tyne and the Tweed, with the Britons moving to the less fertile hill country and becoming acculturated over a longer period. Fox describes the process by which English came to dominate this region as "a synthesis of mass-migration and elite-takeover models."

Vikings and the Danelaw
[
edit

Further information:
Vikings
and
Danelaw
Æthelred II (
c.
966 - 23 April 1016), known as 'the Unready', was
King of the English
from 978 to 1013 and again from 1014 until his death.
From about 800 AD waves of
Danish
Viking assaults on the coastlines of the
British Isles
were gradually followed by a succession of Danish settlers in England. At first, the Vikings were very much considered a separate people from the English. This separation was enshrined when
Alfred the Great
signed the
Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum
to establish the Danelaw, a division of England between English and Danish rule, with the Danes occupying northern and eastern England.
[69]
However, Alfred's successors subsequently won military victories against the Danes, incorporating much of the Danelaw into the nascent kingdom of England. Danish invasions continued into the 11th century, and there were both English and Danish kings in the period following the unification of England (for example,
Æthelred II
[a]
(978-1013 and 1014-1016) was English but
Cnut
(1016-1035) was Danish).
Gradually, the Danes in England came to be seen as 'English'. They had a noticeable impact on the English language: many English words, such as
anger
,
ball
,
egg
,
got
,
knife
,
take
, and
they
, are
of Old Norse origin
,
[70]
and place names that end in
-thwaite
and
-by
are Scandinavian in origin.
[71]
English unification
[
edit
]
Further information:
Treaty of Wedmore
and
Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum
The English population was not politically unified until the 10th century. Before then, there were a number of
petty kingdoms
which gradually coalesced into a
heptarchy
of seven states, the most powerful of which were
Mercia
and
Wessex
. The English
nation state
began to form when the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms united against Danish Viking invasions, which began around 800 AD. Over the following century and a half England was for the most part a politically unified entity, and remained permanently so after 959.
The nation of England was formed in 937 by
Æthelstan
of Wessex after the
Battle of Brunanburh
,
[72]
[73]
as Wessex grew from a relatively small kingdom in the South West to become the founder of the Kingdom of the English, incorporating all
Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms and the Danelaw.
[74]
Norman and Angevin rule
[
edit
]
Further information:
Normans
Battle of Hastings
, 1066 (from the
Bayeux Tapestry
)
The
Norman conquest of England
during 1066 brought Anglo-Saxon and Danish rule of England to an end, as the new
French speaking
Norman
elite almost universally replaced the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and church leaders. After the conquest, "English" normally included all natives of England, whether they were of Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian or Celtic ancestry, to distinguish them from the Norman invaders, who were regarded as "Norman" even if born in England, for a generation or two after the Conquest.
[75]
The Norman dynasty ruled England for 87 years until the death of
King Stephen
in 1154, when the succession passed to
Henry II
,
House of Plantagenet
(based in France), and England became part of the
Angevin Empire
until 1214.
Various contemporary sources suggest that within 50 years of the invasion most of the Normans outside the royal court had switched to English, with
Anglo-Norman
remaining the prestige language of government and law largely out of social inertia. For example, Orderic Vitalis, a historian born in 1075 and the son of a Norman knight, said that he learned French only as a second language. Anglo-Norman continued to be used by the Plantagenet kings until
Edward I
came to the throne.
[76]
Over time the English language became more important even in the court, and the Normans were gradually assimilated, until, by the 14th century, both rulers and subjects regarded themselves as English and spoke the English language.
[77]
Despite the assimilation of the Normans, the distinction between 'English' and 'French' survived in official documents long after it had fallen out of common use, in particular in the legal phrase
Presentment of Englishry
(a rule by which a
hundred
had to prove an unidentified murdered body found on their soil to be that of an Englishman, rather than a Norman, if they wanted to avoid a fine). This law was abolished in 1340.

United Kingdom
Since the 18th century, England has been one part of a wider political entity covering all or part of the British Isles, which today is called the United Kingdom.
Wales
was
annexed
by England by the
Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542
, which incorporated Wales into the English state.
[79]
A new British identity was subsequently developed when
James VI of Scotland
became
James I of England
as well, and expressed the desire to be known as the monarch of Britain.
[80]
In 1707, England formed a union with
Scotland
by passing an
Act of Union
in March 1707 that ratified the
Treaty of Union
. The
Parliament of Scotland
had previously passed its own Act of Union, so the
Kingdom of Great Britain
was born on 1 May 1707. In 1801, another
Act of Union
formed a union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the
Kingdom of Ireland
, creating the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
. In 1922, about two-thirds of the Irish population (those who lived in 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland), left the United Kingdom to form the
Irish Free State
. The remainder became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although this name was not introduced until 1927, after some years in which the term "United Kingdom" had been little used.

Throughout the history of the UK, the English have been dominant in population and in political weight. As a consequence, notions of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness' are often very similar. At the same time, after the Union of 1707, the English, along with the other peoples of the British Isles, have been encouraged to think of themselves as British rather than to identify themselves with the constituent nations.

Immigration and assimilation
[
edit
]
See also:
Historical immigration to Great Britain
and
Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)
England has been the destination of varied numbers of migrants at different periods from the 17th century onwards. While some members of these groups seek to practise a form of pluralism, attempting to maintain a separate ethnic identity, others have
assimilated
and
intermarried
with the English. Since
Oliver Cromwell
's
resettlement of the Jews
in 1656, there have been waves of
Jewish
immigration from
Russia
in the 19th century and from Germany in the 20th.
[82]
After the French king
Louis XIV
declared
Protestantism
illegal in 1685 in the
Edict of Fontainebleau
, an estimated 50,000 Protestant
Huguenots
fled to England.
[83]
Due to sustained and sometimes mass emigration of the
Irish
, current estimates indicate that around 6 million people in the UK have at least one grandparent born in the Republic of Ireland.
[84]
There has been a small
black
presence in England since the 16th century due to the
slave trade
,
[85]
and a small
Indian
presence since at least the 17th century because of the
East India Company
[86]
and
British Raj
.
[85]
Black
and
Asian
populations have only grown throughout the UK generally, as immigration from the British Empire and the subsequent
Commonwealth of Nations
was encouraged due to labour shortages during post World War II rebuilding.
[87]
However, these groups are often still considered to be ethnic minorities and research has shown that black and Asian people in the UK are more likely to identify as British rather than with one of the state's four constituent nations, including England.
[88]
A nationally representative survey published in June 2021 found that a majority of respondents thought that being English was not dependent on race. 77% of white respondents in England agreed that "Being English is open to people of different ethnic backgrounds who identify as English", whereas 14% were of the view that "Only people who are white count as truly English". Amongst ethnic minority respondents, the equivalent figures were 68% and 19%.
[89]
Research has found that the proportion of people who consider being white to be a necessary component of Englishness has declined over time.
[90]
Current national and political identity
[
edit
]
The 1990s witnessed a resurgence of English national identity.
[91]
Survey data shows a rise in the number of people in England describing their national identity as English and a fall in the number describing themselves as British.
[92]
Today, black and minority ethnic people of England still generally identify as British rather than English to a greater extent than their white counterparts;
[93]
however, groups such as the
Campaign for an English Parliament
(CEP) suggest the emergence of a broader civic and multi-ethnic English nationhood.
[94]
Scholars and journalists have noted a rise in English self-consciousness, with increased use of the
English flag
, particularly at football matches where the
Union flag
was previously more commonly flown by fans.
[95]
[96]
This perceived rise in English self-consciousness has generally been attributed to the
devolution
in the late 1990s of some powers to the
Scottish Parliament
and
National Assembly for Wales
.
[91]
In policy areas for which the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have responsibility, the UK Parliament votes on laws that consequently only apply to England. Because the Westminster Parliament is composed of MPs from throughout the United Kingdom, this has given rise to the "
West Lothian question
", a reference to the situation in which MPs representing constituencies outside England can vote on matters affecting only England, but MPs cannot vote on the same matters in relation to the other parts of the UK.
[97]
Consequently, groups such as the CEP have called for the creation of a
devolved English Parliament
, claiming that there is now a discriminatory democratic deficit against the English. The establishment of an English parliament has also been backed by a number of Scottish and Welsh nationalists.
[98]
[99]
Writer
Paul Johnson
has suggested that like most dominant groups, the English have only demonstrated interest in their ethnic self-definition when they were feeling oppressed.
[100]
John Curtice
argues that "In the early years of devolution...there was little sign" of an English backlash against devolution for Scotland and Wales, but that more recently survey data shows tentative signs of "a form of English nationalism...beginning to emerge among the general public".
[101]
Michael Kenny,
Richard English
and Richard Hayton, meanwhile, argue that the resurgence in English nationalism predates devolution, being observable in the early 1990s, but that this resurgence does not necessarily have negative implications for the perception of the UK as a political union.
[102]
Others question whether devolution has led to a rise in English national identity at all, arguing that survey data fails to portray the complex nature of national identities, with many people considering themselves both English
and
British.
[103]
A 2017 survey by
YouGov
found that 38% of English voters considered themselves both English and British, alongside 19% who felt English but not British.
[104]
Recent surveys of public opinion on the establishment of an English parliament have given widely varying conclusions. In the first five years of devolution for Scotland and Wales, support in England for the establishment of an English parliament was low at between 16 and 19%, according to successive
British Social Attitudes Surveys
.
[105]
A report, also based on the British Social Attitudes Survey, published in December 2010 suggests that only 29% of people in England support the establishment of an English parliament, though this figure had risen from 17% in 2007.
[106]
One 2007 poll carried out for
BBC
Newsnight
, however, found that 61 per cent would support such a parliament being established.
[107]
Krishan Kumar notes that support for measures to ensure that only English MPs can vote on legislation that applies only to England is generally higher than that for the establishment of an English parliament, although support for both varies depending on the timing of the opinion poll and the wording of the question.
[108]
Electoral support for English nationalist parties is also low, even though there is public support for many of the policies they espouse.
[109]
The
English Democrats
gained just 64,826 votes in the
2010 UK general election
, accounting for 0.3 per cent of all votes cast in England.
[110]
Kumar argued in 2010 that "despite devolution and occasional bursts of English nationalism - more an expression of exasperation with the Scots or Northern Irish - the English remain on the whole satisfied with current constitutional arrangements".

From the earliest times English people have left England to settle in other parts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but it is not possible to identify their numbers, as British censuses have historically not invited respondents to identify themselves as English.
[118]
[
]
However, the census does record place of birth, revealing that 8.1% of Scotland's population,
[119]
3.7% of the population of Northern Ireland
[120]
and 20% of the Welsh population were born in England.
[121]
Similarly, the census of the Republic of Ireland does not collect information on ethnicity, but it does record that there are over 200,000 people living in Ireland who were born in
England and Wales
.
[122]
English ethnic descent and emigrant communities are found primarily in the
Western World
, and in some places, settled in significant numbers. Substantial populations descended from English colonists and immigrants exist in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.

English Americans
George Washington
, known as the "Father of His Country", and first
President of the United States
, had English
ancestors
.
[123]
In the 2016
American Community Survey
,
English Americans
were 7.4% of the United States population, behind the
German Americans
(13.9%) and
Irish Americans
(10.0%).
[116]
However,
demographers
regard this as a serious undercount, as the index of inconsistency
[
clarification needed

is high, and many, if not most, people from English stock have a tendency (since the introduction of a new 'American' category in the 2000 census) to identify as simply
Americans
[124]
[125]
[126]
[127]
or if of mixed European ancestry, identify with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.
[128]
Prior to this, in the
2000 census
, 24,509,692 Americans described their
ancestry
as wholly or partly English. In addition, 1,035,133 recorded British ancestry.
[129]
This was a numerical decrease from the census in
1990
where 32,651,788 people or 13.1% of the population self-identified with English ancestry.
[130]
In
1980
, over 49 million (49,598,035) Americans claimed English ancestry, at the time around 26.3% of the total population and largest reported group which, even today, would make them the largest ethnic group in the United States.
[131]
Scots-Irish Americans
are descendants of
Lowland Scots
and
Northern English
(specifically:
County Durham
,
Cumberland
,
Northumberland
and
Westmorland
) settlers who colonised Ireland during the
Plantation of Ulster
in the 17th century.
Americans
of English heritage are often seen, and identify, as simply "American" due to the many historic cultural ties between England and the U.S. and their influence on the country's population. Relative to ethnic groups of other European origins, this may be due to the early establishment of English settlements; as well as to non-English groups having emigrated in order to establish significant communities.
[132]
Canada
[

Main article:
English Canadians
In the
Canada 2016 Census
, 'English' was the most common ethnic origin (ethnic origin refers to the ethnic or cultural group(s) to which the respondent's ancestors belong
[133]
) recorded by respondents; 6,320,085 people or 18.3% of the population self-identified themselves as wholly or partly English.
[113]
[114]
On the other hand, people identifying as Canadian but not English may have previously identified as English before the option of identifying as Canadian was available.

Main article:
English Australians
Edmund Barton
and
Alfred Deakin
, 1st and 2nd
Prime Minister of Australia
both had English parents.
From the beginning of the
colonial era
until the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers to Australia were from the
British Isles
, with the English being the dominant group. Among the leading ancestries, increases in Australian, Irish and German ancestries and decreases in English, Scottish and Welsh ancestries appear to reflect such shifts in perception or reporting. These reporting shifts at least partly resulted from changes in the design of the census question, in particular the introduction of a tick box format in 2001.
[135]
English Australians have more often come from the
south
than the
north of England
.
[136]
Australians
of English descent, are both the single largest ethnic group in Australia and the largest 'ancestry' identity in the Australian census.
[137]
In the
2016 census
, 7.8 million or 36.1% of the population identified as "English" or a combination including English, a numerical increase from 7.2 million over the 2011 census figure. The census also documented 907,572 residents or 3.9% of Australia as being born in England, and are the largest overseas-born population.

English ancestry is the largest single ancestry New Zealanders share. Several million New Zealanders are estimated to have some English ancestry
[138]
From 1840, the English comprised the largest single group among New Zealand's overseas-born, consistently being over 50 percent of the total population.
[139]
Despite this, after the early 1850s, the English-born slowly fell from being a majority of the colonial population. In the
1851 census
, 50.5% of the total population were born in England, this proportion fell to 36.5% (1861) and 24.3% by 1881.
[139]
New Zealand
's foundational culture was
English
, given the strong representation in the mid and late-nineteenth century with the English being the largest in migration inflows.
[140]
In the
2013
census, there were 215,589 English-born representing 21.5% of all overseas-born residents or 5 percent of the total population and the most-common birthplace outside New Zealand.
[141]
In the recent
2018 census
, 210,915 were born in England or 4.49% of the total population, a slight decrease from 2013.

Main article:
English Argentines
William Henry Hudson
was an Argentine author, naturalist, and ornithologist of English origin.
English settlers arrived in
Buenos Aires
in 1806 (then a Spanish colony) in small numbers, mostly as businessmen, when
Argentina
was an emerging nation and the settlers were welcomed for the stability they brought to commercial life. As the 19th century progressed, more English families arrived, and many bought land to develop the potential of the Argentine pampas for the large-scale growing of crops. The English founded banks, developed the export trade in crops and animal products and imported the luxuries that the growing Argentine middle classes sought.
[142]
As well as those who went to
Argentina
as industrialists and major landowners, others went as
railway engineers
,
civil engineers
and to work in
banking
and
commerce
. Others went to become
whalers
,
missionaries
and simply to seek out a future. English families sent second and younger sons, or what were described as the
black sheep
of the family, to Argentina to make their fortunes in
cattle
and
wheat
. English settlers introduced
football
to Argentina. Some English families owned
sugar plantations
.

The culture of England is sometimes difficult to separate clearly from the

The
established religion
of the realm is the
Church of England
, whose titular head is
Charles III
although the worldwide
Anglican Communion
is overseen by the
General Synod
of its bishops under the authority of
Parliament
. 26 of the church's 42 bishops are
Lords Spiritual
, representing the church in the
House of Lords
. In 2010, the Church of England counted 25 million baptised members out of the 41 million Christians in Great Britain's population of about 60 million;
[144]
[145]
around the same time, it also claimed to baptise one in eight newborn children.
[146]
Generally, anyone in England may marry or be buried at their local
parish church
, whether or not they have been baptised in the church.
[147]
Actual attendance has declined steadily since 1890,
[148]
with around one million, or 10% of the baptised population attending Sunday services on a regular basis (defined as once a month or more) and three million -roughly 15%- joining Christmas Eve and Christmas services.

English people traditionally speak the
English language
, a member of the
West Germanic
language family
. The modern English language evolved from
Middle English
(the form of language in use by the English people from the 12th to the 15th century); Middle English was influenced lexically by Norman-French,
Old French
and
Latin
. In the Middle English period Latin was the language of administration and the nobility spoke Norman French. Middle English was itself derived from the
Old English
of the Anglo-Saxon period; in the Northern and Eastern parts of England the language of Danish settlers had influenced the language, a fact still evident in Northern English dialects.
[

There were once many different dialects of modern English in England, which were recorded in projects such as the
English Dialect Dictionary
(late 19th century) and the
Survey of English Dialects
(mid 20th century), but there has been widespread
dialect levelling
in recent time as a result of education, the media and socio-economic pressures.
[153]
Cornish
, a
Celtic language
, is one of three existing Brittonic languages; its usage has been revived in
Cornwall
. Historically, another Brittonic Celtic language,
Cumbric
, was spoken in
Cumbria
in
North West England
, but it died out in the 11th century although traces of it can still be found in the Cumbrian dialect.
Early Modern English
began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the
printing press
to London and the
Great Vowel Shift
. Through the worldwide influence of the
British Empire
, English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, broadcasters (such as the
BBC
) and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, Modern English has become the
international language
of
business
,
science
,
communication
,
sports
,
aviation
, and

;
c.
1340s
- 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the
Middle Ages
, he is best known for
The Canterbury Tales
.
English literature begins with
Anglo-Saxon literature
, which was written in
Old English
and produced epic works such as
Beowulf
and the fragmentary
The Battle of Maldon
,
The Seafarer
and
The Wanderer
. For many years,
Latin
and
French
were the preferred literary languages of England, but in the
medieval period
there was a flourishing of literature in
Middle English
;
Geoffrey Chaucer
is the most famous writer of this period.
The
Elizabethan era
is sometimes described as the golden age of English literature with writers such as
William Shakespeare
,
Thomas Nashe
,
Edmund Spenser
,
Sir Philip Sidney
,
Christopher Marlowe
and
Ben Jonson
.
Other famous English writers include
Jane Austen
,
Arnold Bennett
,
Rupert Brooke
,
Agatha Christie
,
Charles Dickens
,
Thomas Hardy
,
A. E. Housman
,
George Orwell
and the
Lake Poets
.
Due to the expansion of English into a
world language
during the British Empire, literature is now written in English across the world.

Plot summary
[
edit
]
Season 1:
Dino Charge
[
edit
]
Sixty-five million years ago, a dinosauroid
alien
named Keeper was pursued through the galaxy by Sledge, an intergalactic
bounty hunter
bent on acquiring ten magical stones called the Energems in Keeper's care and using them to conquer the universe. Keeper crash landed on prehistoric
Earth
, entrusting the gems to many
dinosaurs
for safe-keeping and crippled Sledge's ship with a bomb that left the bounty hunter stranded in deep space. Unfortunately, Sledge's collection of asteroids held in a tractor beam accidentally rained down on prehistoric Earth and ultimately caused
the extinction of the dinosaurs
.
In the present day, Keeper is found by paleontologist Kendall Morgan and they set up a base under the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum in the city of Amber Beach. They begin a mission to find the Energems, but five have already been found by teenagers, who use them to morph into the Dino Charge Power Rangers. The group consists of the Red Ranger, Tyler Navarro, the adventurous leader of the group who is searching for his father who disappeared ten years ago on a geological dig; the Pink Ranger, Shelby Watkins, a
waitress
with a vast knowledge of dinosaurs; the Blue Ranger, Koda, a
Cave man
living in modern times as he found his Energem in his tribe's cave, and was kept in suspended animation until the present day; the Green Ranger, Riley Griffin, the youngest of the group who is a skilled fencing swordsman; and the Black Ranger, Chase Randall, the suave and laid-back
New Zealander
. With these powers, the Dino Charge Power Rangers fight against Sledge, Poisandra, Fury, Wrench, Curio, and their prison full of monsters in order to find the remaining Energems and protect Earth.
As time goes by, the Rangers are joined by additional teammates with additional Dino Zords: the Gold Ranger, Sir Ivan, an eight-hundred-year-old
knight
from Zandar who was trapped in the body of Sledge's minion Fury and the Graphite Ranger Prince Phillip III of Zandar, the modern day crown prince of Ivan's home country. Kendall takes over the position of the Purple Ranger from Albert Smith who abandons the position due to his fears of Fury's minions. New threats also emerge, including the human-like villain, Heckyl.
Season 2:
Dino Super Charge
[
edit
]
The Ranger team gets two new members: the Aqua Ranger, who is revealed to be Tyler's long lost father James and the Silver Ranger, who is revealed to be Zenowing, a follower and apprentice of Keeper. However, with new powers come new enemies in the form of Singe, a mysterious warrior who arrives on Earth and quickly steps in as Heckyl's number two, much to Fury's anger. However, Heckyl starts to get curious when he realizes that Singe knows more about the Energems than he admits. After the Rangers discover the location of the Titano Zord, Heckyl demands to know how Singe knew its location, only for Singe to flee and return to Earth with the person who hired him named Lord Arcanon, who holds the evil Dark Energem. It was Lord Arcanon who hired Sledge to bring him the galaxy's most dangerous monsters to make an army out of them. Arcanon's reign ends with the return of Sledge who destroys his former employer with Snide (who was split from Heckyl) before Sledge betrays him and let the Rangers destroyed Snide too and takes back leadership of his crew. At that time, Heckyl regains all of his memories as a good person, which he lost from the Dark Energem. The Rangers went back in time and destroyed Sledge and his crew in the past.
After their enemies' destruction, the Rangers go their separate ways as Koda and Ivan finally go back to their own times, Heckyl becomes the guardian of the Dark Energem as he and Zenowing return to Sentai 6, and Keeper returns to his home planet. The present day Rangers arrive back to their own time and find that it is a zoo and there are live dinosaurs since Sledge's asteroids never hit Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs never came to pass.

Arcanon leaves Doomwing to be destroyed while Singe and Fury search for the misplaced Dark Energem. After an intense battle, the Rangers destroy the revived monsters, and Zenowing can reclaim the Silver Energem and destroy Doomwing by morphing. Back aboard Sledge's ship, Poisandra gives Heckyl an explosive that allows him to break out of his cell. Still, upon seeing Singe returning the Dark Energem to Arcanon, he remembers his true past as an inhabitant of Sentai 6 who attempted to keep the Dark Energem away from Arcanon only to have Snide created as his evil half in the process. Heckyl is then re-imprisoned, swearing revenge on Arcanon as he does so, while Zenowing bonds with his fellow Rangers.

The Rangers find a Greenzilla Egg in Amber Beach. Snide helps Sledge prepare for his wedding and hears him plotting against him. At the Dino Bite Café, the Rangers give Heckyl his food, and he talks to the Rangers and warns them about the upcoming doom. The Rangers look at the Greenzilla egg.

The other rangers struggle fighting against the Greenzillas, and Heckyl watches them until he decides to help them after helping a girl find her mom. Heckyl watches a transport pod land in Amber Beach. Koda and Shelby activate the Dino Charge Megazord Tri-Ankylo formation, and the Greenzilla is defeated. Tyler and the Spino Zord help Chase, Ivan, and Riley. They form the Spino Charge Megazord Para-Raptor formation and defeat the Greenzilla.

The Rangers thank Heckyl and head back to base. Wrench and Sledge watch this from space. Sledge makes 4 of the eggs act as anchors, planning to drag the planet out of the orbit of the sun. The Rangers fight Vivix and Spikeballs outside the base. Fury confronts Keeper, but the Rangers rescue him. Fury retreats, and the Rangers receive a message from Sledge. Sledge fires four beams from his ship, and they attach to the eggs as a winch. Sledge pulls the planet away from the sun. The Rangers discuss the Dark Energem. Ivan uses the Dino Super Drive Saber in the Ptera Zord and Black, Blue, Keeper, Pink, and Green. They warn the citizens, and Graphite, Purple & Heckyl, Red, Aqua, and Silver take the Plesio Zord. The Dark Energem is thrown into space. Everyone in Amber Beach holds up mirrors and reflects the sun’s rays, and with a combined Megazord attack, the Dark Energem is destroyed, but it turns into a black hole. Earth is cut off from Sledge’s ship as it falls into the black hole. The Black Hole sucks on earth. The Rangers throw their Energems into a circle to form a wormhole to travel back in time, and the Rangers head inside. They arrive, and Shelby spots living dinosaurs. They watch Keeper’s ship crash and realize this was the day when Keeper entrusted the Energems to dinosaurs. Sledge notices the Rangers. Keeper finds the bomb and the Energems. The Rangers help Keeper as Sledge and Fury approach earth. Sledge and Fury arrive. The Rangers morph and activate Dino Steel. They fight against Vivix, Sledge, and Fury. Fury finds the remaining "energems" and hands them to Sledge to find a bomb instead, having been tricked by Tyler. Fury is killed by the impact of the bomb when it explodes. Tyler uses T-Rex Supercharge against Sledge. Sledge blasts the Rangers and uses the magma beam. James, Phillip, Kendall, Zenowing, and Heckyl attack from inside the ship and attach Sledge to the ship. The Plesio Zord escapes as Sledge’s ship crashes into the sun and kills him, Poisandra, and Wrench in the process. Keeper thanks the Rangers. He tells Koda and Ivan they will return to their ages. The Rangers say goodbye to Ivan and Koda. Everyone else leaves. Keeper informs Heckyl and Zenowing they will return to Sentai 6. Heckyl is given a guardian's uniform. The Rangers arrive home and find that it is now a dinosaur zoo, as their past actions have prevented the dinosaur's extinction.

Historic blazon of the Viscounts of Limoges: Or three lions Azure armed and langued Gules.
Foucher de Limoges
was the founder of the House of Limoges-Rochechouart, and the first
Viscount of Limoges
.
Family
[
edit
]
The second son of
Raymond I
,
Count of Toulouse
, and of Berteys, daughter of Rémi. The viscounts of Limoges and of
Rochechouart
are thus descended from the
Counts of Rouergue
and probably from the
Count of Autun
and from Théodoric, who founded the Autun dynasty c. 730.
Viscount of Limoges
[
edit
]
Foucher was a supporter of
Charles the Bald
and was rewarded for his services in the king's wars by being granted the
Viscountcy of Limoges
, which extended into
Limousin
and
Berry
. Foucher was crowned as viscount in 876 in
Limoges
and started minting his own coinage. The promulgation of the
Capitulary of Quierzy
the following year simultaneously freed the lords up from royal authority and made their titles and
charges
hereditary, thus giving birth to the French
feudal
system.  Like other lords, the viscount of Limoges became an autonomous territory, administered by viscount Foucher.  On his death, in 886, his son Hildebert became lord of Limoges, and then Hildebert's son Hildegaire, then Hildebert's grandson Géraud, establishing in a lasting way the dynasty of viscounts in their fiefdom of Limoges.

Drinking water supply and sanitation in Argentina
is characterized by relatively low tariffs, mostly reasonable service quality, low levels of metering and high levels of consumption for those with access to services. At the same time, according to the
WHO
, 21% of the total population remains without access to house connections and 52% of the urban population do not have access to sewerage. The responsibility for operating and maintaining water and sanitation services rests with 19 provincial water and sewer companies, more than 100 municipalities and more than 950 cooperatives, the latter operating primarily in small towns. Among the largest water and sewer companies are
Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos
(AYSA) and Aguas Bonarenses S.A. (ABSA), both operating in
Greater Buenos Aires
, Aguas Provinciales de
Santa Fe
, and Aguas Cordobesas SA, all of them now publicly owned. In 2008 there were still a few private concessions, such as Aguas de
Salta
SA, which is majority-owned by Argentine investors, and Obras Sanitarias de
Mendoza
(OSM).
Most service providers barely recover operation and maintenance costs and have no capacity to self-finance investments. While private operators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery, since the
Argentine financial crisis
in 2002 tariffs have been frozen and the self-financing capacity of utilities has disappeared. Roughly two-thirds of provincial water and sanitation spending since 2002 has come from general transfers from the federal government, the remainder coming from various national programs directed specifically to the sector.
Services are regulated by the 23
Provinces
, in the case of 14 through regulatory agencies that have some limited autonomy from the government. Overall, however, responsibilities are not always clearly defined, and institutions are often weak, subject to political interference and lacking enforcement powers. The various national institutions with policy-setting responsibilities in the sector are not always well coordinated. There is no coherent national policy in terms of sector financing, subsidies, tariffs and service standards. The federal structure of the country and the dispersion of sector responsibilities between and within various levels of government make the development of a coherent sector policy all the more difficult.
Between 1991 and 1999, as part of one of the world's largest privatization programs covering a range of sectors, water and sanitation concessions with the private sector were signed covering 28% of the country's municipalities and 60% of the population.
[5]
The highest profile concession was signed in 1993 with a consortium led by the French firm
Suez
for the central parts of
Greater Buenos Aires
. After the
2001 economic crisis
, many concessions were renegotiated. Many were terminated, as it was the case in
Buenos Aires
in 2006.
[6]
The impact of private sector participation in water and sanitation is a controversial topic. While the public perception of the mostly international concessionaires is overwhelmingly negative in Argentina, some studies show positive impacts. For example, a 2002 study assessed the impact of privatization on child mortality based on household survey data, finding that child mortality fell 5 to 7 percent more in areas that privatized compared to those that remained under public or cooperative management.
[7]
The authors estimate that the main reason is the massive expansion of access to water. According to
Suez
, the private concession in Buenos Aires extended access to water to 2 million people and access to sanitation to 1 million people, despite a freeze in tariffs imposed by the government in 2001 in violation of the concession agreement. The government argues that the concessionaire did not fully comply with its obligations concerning expansion and quality, saying that the supplied water had high levels of nitrate, pressure obligations were not kept and scheduled works were not carried out.
[8]
Access
[
edit
]
In Argentina, in 2015, 99% of the population had access to "special" water, 98.9% in urban areas  and 99.9% in rural areas. Still, in 2015, around 390 thousand lacked access to "improved" water. Regarding access to "improved" sanitation it includes 96% of the population, 96% and 98%, in urban and rural areas, respectively. Approximately, 1.5 million of people were still without access to "improved" sanitation, in 2015.

According to a study by the

Service quality
[
edit
]
Map of Argentina.

[12]
In urban areas of Argentina, service is generally continuous and of potable quality.
[2]
However, water rationing occurs in some cities during the summer months, and drinking water quality is sometimes sub-standard.
In Buenos Aires, in 2008 there were two water treatment plants and a new one was about to begin.
[13]
Concerning sanitation, existing sewage collection systems are insufficient to handle the increasing flows as a growing number of households connect to the sewer systems, leading to frequent sewer overflows.
The level of
wastewater treatment
varies among the Argentinean regions. According to the Pan American Health Organization, at the national level 10% of the collected wastewater was being treated in 2000. Whereas in many regional capitals, such as
Mendoza
,
Córdoba
,
Tucumán
,
Neuquén
,
Jujuy
,
Salta
and
San Juan
, most of the wastewater was treated, in the two largest
urban areas
of the country,
Buenos Aires
and
Rosario
, there was practically no treatment at all, resulting in serious environmental problems. However, in 2008 a bidding process was launched to build a
wastewater treatment
plant in Buenos Aires.
[13]
History and recent developments
[
edit
]
From 1880 until 1980, the national utility
Obras Sanitarias de la Nación
(OSN) was in charge of providing water and sewer services in the main cities, while in smaller cities it was the responsibility of provincial governments, municipalities and cooperatives.
In 1980 the military government under
Jorge Rafael Videla
decentralized the provision of water and sanitation services in the main cities served by OSN, except for the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires where OSN continued to provide services. In other cities OSN transferred its responsibilities to provincial governments. Each province chose its model of service provision (municipal, public enterprises, cooperatives or others).
Between 1991 and 1999 under the government of
Carlos Menem
, as part of one of the world's largest privatization programs covering a range of sectors, water and sanitation concessions with the private sector were signed in 28% of the country's municipalities covering 60% of the population.
[5]
The highest profile concession was signed in 1993 with a consortium led by the French firm
Suez
for
the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires
. After the
2001 economic crisis
, under the government of
Néstor Kirchner
, many concessions were renegotiated. Some were even terminated and the responsibility for service provision reverted to public entities, as it was the case in Buenos Aires where the newly created public enterprise
Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos
took over the responsibility for service provision in 2006.
[6]
At the beginning of 2008, the government of the
Province of Mendoza
announced that it is interested in increasing its control of the provincial water utility "Obras Sanitarias de Mendoza", of which it owns 20%, buying another 20% from Saur International.
[14]
Impact of private sector participation
[
edit
]
So far there has been no comprehensive, objective assessment of the impact of private sector participation in water supply and sanitation in Argentina. However, there has been some partial evidence. For example, a 2002 study assessed the impact of privatization on child mortality based on household survey data, finding that in the 1991-1997 period child mortality fell 5 to 7 percent more in areas that privatized compared to those that remained under public or cooperative management. It also found that the effect was largest in poorest areas (24%).
[7]
The authors estimate that the main reason is the massive expansion of access to water, which was concentrated in poorer areas that did not receive services before private sector participation was introduced.
The Buenos Aires concession
[
edit
]
The largest and best-known case of private sector participation in the Argentine water and sanitation sector was the Buenos Aires concession, signed in 1993 and revoked in 2006. Its impact remains controversial and in early 2008 an arbitration case was still pending with the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) of the World Bank Group.
Critics argue that the concessionaire failed to achieve the targets set under the concession contract. When the government rescinded the concession in March 2006, it argued that Aguas Argentinas did not comply with obligations concerning expansion and quality. According to the government, the supplied water had high levels of nitrate, pressure obligations were not kept and scheduled waterworks were not executed by the concessionaire.
[8]
On the other hand, proponents of private participation state that a freeze in tariffs at the time of the devaluation of the Peso during the Argentinean economic crisis in 2001 substantially reduced the real value of tariff revenues and thus made it difficult to achieve the original targets.
One factor which may have caused the cancellation of the concession contract was the precipitate preparation. Alcazar et al. list some features of the concession which indicate an overhasty process:
[15]
The regulatory agency ETOSS (
Ente Tripartito de Obras de Servicios de Saneamiento
, Tripartite Entity for Sanitary Services) lacked experience, since it was founded quickly as part of the concession process.
The available information in the concession contract about the state of the existing infrastructure was so poor, that the Argentinean government denied taking responsibility for it. This lack of information could have let the bidder to accept the contract in the expectation of future renegotiation.
[16]
Instead of creating a new and more transparent tariff system, the old one was adopted from OSN.
In addition, the inexperienced regulatory agency was repeatedly bypassed when decisions were taken, for example in the renegotiation of the contract in 1997. In that way, ETOSS was further weakened.
[17]
The concession contract authorized Aguas Argentinas to demand dollars at the old 1:1 exchange rate after the peso devaluation. Solanes points out that without this practice companies may seek financing in local capital markets to avoid currency fluctuations. He also argues that the needs of the poor were not addressed in the concession. No subsidies were provided for the poor and the tariff system did not encourage expansion of coverage to poor areas, since new connections were often unaffordable and new users also had to pay the costs of expanding the network.
[18]
The concessionaire did invest much more than its public predecessor and achieved substantial increases in access to water and sewerage. According to the Argentinean economist Sebastian Galiani, the public company OSN had invested only US$25m per year between 1983 and 1993, while the private concessionaire Aguas Argentinas increased investments to around US$200 m per year between 1993 and 2000.
[19]
According to
Suez
, during the 13 year-duration of its concession it extended access to water to 2 million people and access to sanitation to 1 million people, despite the economic crisis. Between 2003 and 2005 alone about 100,000 inhabitants of poor neighborhoods and slums are said to have been connected through a "participatory management model" piloted by Aguas Argentinas. Aspects of the model have been adopted by the government to extend services to another 400,000 people in La Matanza in the province of Buenos Aires in the project "Water plus work" ("Aguas más trabajo").
[20]
An example of local private sector participation: Salta
[
edit
]
The government of
Salta Province
initiated the reform of its water sector in 1996. At the same time many other Argentinean provinces and municipalities brought in the private sector to improve water and sanitation services. While Salta also followed this approach, the process differed somewhat from the one in many other parts of Argentina.
[21]
First, the provincial government conducted a series of meetings with municipalities and user organizations to discuss the benefits and risks of the concession before it was bid out. This process of consultations was continued by the private concessionaire after the contract was awarded. Second, the government decided from the onset that water and sanitation services in the poor province could not be financed entirely through tariff revenues. It thus decided to finance much of the investments to be undertaken by the private concessionaire with public grants, in addition to providing consumption subsidies. Third, the regulatory agency allowed the concessionaire to provide services at a lower standard in remote or isolated areas that were deemed unprofitable at conventional service standards. Fourth, the provincial regulatory agency granted tariff increases before and even after the 2001 economic crisis. These tariff increases were lower than it would have been necessary without subsidies or flexible service standards. And fifth, the government "ignored the traditional paradigm of only permitting companies with significant previous experience in water supply and sanitation to compete in the bidding process". This provision had favored a few large multinational water firms in other bidding processes. In Salta, however, the bid was won by the Argentinean construction, power and toll road enterprise MECON S.A. which signed a technical assistance contract with the Brazilian
Paraná
State public utility SANEPAR.
[21]
The private concession led to a substantial increase in access to water and sanitation from the time of concession award in 1999 to 2005. It also provided a significant decrease in service interruptions and improved customer service. 13 more municipalities joined the concession contract after it had been signed in order to share in its benefits, bringing the total number of municipalities served by the concessionaire to 56.
[21]
While most other private water concessions in Argentina were rescinded in the years after the 2001 economic crisis, the Salta concession has been upheld until 2009 despite a number of problems. In February 2008 the regulatory agency initiated penal proceedings against the concessionaire because one of its
wastewater treatment
plants discharging to the Arenales River was not functioning.
[22]
In June 2008 the company was accused of not having complied with contractual targets for the installation of meters, water pressure, continuity of supply, drinking water quality norms, and of applying excessive interests on late payments.
[23]
In May 2009
Juan Manuel Urtubey
, governor of the Province, terminated the concession contract because of non-compliance and created a transition unit to provide services until a state company would be created whose shares would be held by the Province (90%) and workers (10%).
[24]
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation
[
edit
]
Policy and regulation
[
edit
]
Provinces have responsibility for setting rules and policies in the sector for their area. Institutions are weak, subject to political interference and lacking in enforcement powers. 14 out of 23 provinces have regulatory bodies, but they often have limited capacity and unclear institutional responsibilities. In most cases, they act as supervisors of private concession contracts, not covering public and cooperative service providers. This autonomy of provinces resulted in a highly heterogeneous system of water supply and sanitation.
[25]
Moreover, it hinders to create an overview of the situation at the national level.
Despite recent progress in clarifying responsibilities, the institutional framework at the national level still lacks coherence and coordination among federal actors is weak. The
proposes sector policies to the
which approves them. Within this policy framework the
, a decentralized agency under the Ministry of Public Works, provides financing and technical assistance to service providers. As an advisor to the Ministry of Public Works it de facto influences sector policies. ENOHSA has also been given the faculty to directly execute infrastructure works. There has been some confusion between its position as conceding power (in the
Buenos Aires
concession) and as policy-maker for the overall sector. There is no coherent national policy in terms of sector financing, subsidies, tariffs and service standards. Nor is there a sector law for water and sanitation. The federal structure of the country and the dispersion of sector responsibilities between and within various levels of government make the development of a coherent sector policy all the more difficult.
Service provision
[
edit
]
Provision of water and sanitation supply in Argentina is organized on a municipal or provincial basis by around 1,650 public, cooperative and private entities of various forms. 14 service providers are provincial (Argentina has 23 provinces), but do not necessarily serve the entire province. Some are multi-municipal, some serve a single municipality and others parts of a municipality. There are at least 990 mostly smaller cooperative service providers in Argentina,
[26]
making Argentina the country in Latin America where this form of service provision is most prevalent.
Financial aspects
[
edit
]
Tariffs
[
edit
]
Bills of
Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos
In 2000, the Argentinean water and sanitation tariff levels were high, given the low quality of services. According to the Panamerican Health Organization (PAHO), the mean tariff for water and sanitation was US$0.79 per m3.
[2]
There are two different tariff systems. The first method is based on the former OSN tariff system. It estimates the consumption of each user according to characteristics such as dwelling size, location of residence and type of dwelling. The second tariff system contains a fixed charge and a variable part which is based on metered consumption. This latter method was made possible by the extensive introduction of
water metering
, which was included in many concession contracts in the 1990s.
[3]
The average household expenditure for water supply and sanitation in 2002 was 2.6%, ranging from 2.1% in the highest (wealthiest) quintile to 3.5% in the lowest (poorest) one.
[27]
Cost recovery
[
edit
]
Most service providers barely recover operation and maintenance costs and have no capacity to self-finance investments. While private operators were able to achieve higher levels of cost recovery and to substantially expand services before the crisis, since 2002 their tariffs have been frozen and their self-financing capacity has disappeared. Service providers thus are almost entirely dependent on federal transfers for investment financing. Roughly two-thirds of provincial water and sanitation spending over the period has come from general transfers from the federal government, the remainder coming from various programs directed specifically to the sector, including for flood protection and water resources management.
When the
linkage of the Argentinean peso to the US-Dollar
was abandoned due to a
serious economic crisis
in 2002, the tariffs did not increase but converted 1 to 1 to the devalued peso, resulting in various contract renegotiations. This decision worsened the financial situation of the suppliers. The lack of financial resources results in problems concerning even in maintaining the supply system.
[25]
Cutting off water services for non-payment is prohibited in Argentina based on a common interpretation of the constitution.

The financing will be used to expand the wastewater treatment plant Las Catonas, which will serve 350 000 people. A new sewage network will also be built across the city, serving about 24 000 persons. The new infrastructure will help safeguard the environment and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions
by recycling
biogas
and decreasing the flow of untreated effluents into surface waterways. The
Inter-American Development Bank
is helping to fund this project.

Aspect of history
Total economic output in England 1270 to 2016
[1]
The
economic history of the United Kingdom
relates the
economic development
in the British state from the absorption of
Wales
into the
Kingdom of England
after
1535
to the modern
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
of the early 21st century.
Scotland
,
England
, and
Wales
shared a monarch from 1601 but their economies were run separately until they were unified in the
1707 Act of Union
.
[2]
Ireland
was incorporated in the United Kingdom economy between 1800 and 1922; from 1922 the
Irish Free State
(the modern
Republic of Ireland
) became independent and set its own economic policy.
Great Britain
, and England in particular, became one of the most prosperous economic regions in the world between the late 1600s and early 1800s as a result of being the birthplace of the
industrial revolution
that began in the mid-eighteenth century.
[3]
The developments brought by
industrialization
resulted in Britain becoming the premier European and global economic, political, and military power for more than a century. As the first to industrialize, Britain's industrialists revolutionized areas like manufacturing, communication, and transportation through innovations such as the steam engine (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, tool-making, the Telegraph, and pioneered the
railway
system. With these many new technologies Britain manufactured much of the equipment and products used by other nations, becoming known as the "workshop of the world". Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. Its markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the rapidly expanding
British Empire
, which by the early 1900s had become the largest empire in history. After 1840, the economic policy of
mercantilism
was abandoned and replaced by
free trade
, with fewer tariffs, quotas or restrictions, first outlined by British economist Adam Smith's
Wealth of Nations
. Britain's globally dominant
Royal Navy
protected British commercial interests, shipping and international trade, while the British legal system provided a system for resolving disputes relatively inexpensively, and the
City of London
functioned as the economic capital and focus of the world economy.
Between 1870 and 1900,
economic output per head
of the
United Kingdom
rose by 50 per cent (from about £28 per capita to £41 in 1900: an annual average increase in real incomes of 1% p.a.), growth which was associated with a significant rise in
living standards
.
[4]
However, and despite this significant economic growth, some economic historians have suggested that Britain experienced a
relative
economic decline in the last third of the nineteenth century as industrial expansion occurred in the
United States
and
Germany
.  In 1870, Britain's output per head was the second highest in the world, surpassed only by
Australia
. In 1914, British income per capita was the world's third highest, exceeded only by
New Zealand
and Australia; these three countries shared a common economic, social and cultural heritage. In 1950, British output per head was still 30 per cent over that of the average of the six founder members of the
EEC
, but within 20 years it had been overtaken by the majority of western European economies.
[5]
[6]
The response of successive British governments to this problematic performance was to seek economic growth stimuli within what became the
European Union
; Britain entered the
European Community
in 1973. Thereafter the United Kingdom's relative economic performance improved substantially to the extent that, on the eve of the
2007 financial crisis
, British income per capita exceeded, albeit marginally, that of
France
and Germany; furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the gap in income per capita terms between the UK and USA.
[7]
16th-17th centuries
[
edit
]
Ancient coat of arms of the Tudor family
During 16th and 17th century many fundamental economic changes occurred, these resulted in rising incomes and paved the way to the industrialisation. After 1600, the
North Sea Region
took over the role of the leading economic centre of Europe from the Mediterranean, which prior to this date, particularly in
northern Italy
, had been the most highly developed part of Europe. Great Britain, together with the
Low Countries
, profited more in the long run from the expansion of trade in the Atlantic and Asia than the pioneers of this trade, Spain and Portugal, fundamentally because of the success of the mainly privately owned enterprises in these two Northern countries in contrast to the arguably less successful state-owned economic systems in Iberia.
[8]
Following the
Black Death
in the mid 14th century, and the agricultural depression of the late 15th century, the population began to increase. The export of woollen products resulted in an economic upturn with products exported to mainland Europe.
Henry VII
negotiated the favourable
Intercursus Magnus
treaty in 1496.
[9]
The high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were temporary. When the population recovered, low wages and a land shortage returned.  Historians in the early 20th century characterized the economic in terms of general decline, manorial reorganization, and agricultural contraction. Later historians dropped those themes and stressed the transitions between medieval forms and Tudor progress.
[10]
John Leland
left rich descriptions of the local economies he witnessed during his travels 1531 to 1560. He described markets, ports, industries, buildings and transport links. He showed some small towns were expanding, through new commercial and industrial opportunities, especially cloth manufacture. He found other towns in decline, and suggested that investment by entrepreneurs and benefactors had enabled some small towns to prosper.
[11]
Taxation was a negative factor in economic growth, since it was imposed, not on consumption, but on capital investments.
[12]
According to
Derek Hirst
, outside of politics and religion, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy characterized by growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialization Of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.
[13]
Credit and money supply
[
edit
]
The economy grew faster than the money supply in this period. Few coins were in circulation due to the scarcity of precious metals and instead most transactions were made on credit. The numerous debts were usually settled during
reckonings
held at convenient intervals. Reciprocal debts were cancelled and only the difference had to be paid with cash. Other than that coins were used for specific purposes such as small transactions between strangers, for paying taxes and for overseas trade. Overall coins formed less than 10% of all exchanges.
[14]
Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the New World exported large quantities of silver and gold to Europe, some of which added to the English money supply. There were multiple results that all expanded the English economy, according to Dr. Nuno Palma of the University of Manchester.  The key features of the growth pattern included specialisation and structural change, and increases in market participation. The new supply of specie (silver and gold) increased the money supply. Instead of promissory notes paid off by future promissory notes, business transactions were supported by specie. This reduced transaction costs, increased the coverage of the market, and opened incentives and opportunities to participate in cash transaction. Demand arose for luxury goods from Asia, such as silk and pepper, which created new markets. The increased supply of specie made tax collection easier, allowing the government to build up fiscal capacity and provide for public goods.
[15]
Various inflationary pressures existed; some were due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population. Inflation had a negative effect on the real wealth of most families.
[16]
It set the stage for social upheaval as the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with
manorial
land owners introducing
enclosure
measures.
[17]
Exports
[
edit
]
Exports increased significantly, especially within the British empire. Mostly privately owned companies traded with the colonies in the
West Indies
,
Northern America
and
India
.
[18]
The
Company of Merchant Adventurers of London
brought together
London
's leading overseas merchants in a regulated company in the early 15th century, in the nature of a
guild
.  Its members' main business was the export of cloth, especially white (undyed) woollen
broadcloth
.  This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods.
[19]
[20]
Given the trade conditions of the time, England came up with a public policy to increase
Armenian
merchant's involvement in English trade to pursue its commercial interests. Accordingly, in 1688 a trade agreement was signed in London between
English East India Company
and Kjoja Panos Kalantar.
Armenian
merchants received privileges to carry out commercial activities in England. England, in its turn, wanted to change the main trade route from Europe to Asia, and from now on,
Armenians
, instead of overlanding in Arabia or Persia, used England. With this agreement, England wanted to take over the control that Dutch and France had at that time on world exports.
[21]
Wool industry
[
edit
]
Further information:
Medieval English wool trade
Woollen cloth was the chief export and most important employer after agriculture. The golden era of the Wiltshire woollen industry was in the reign of Henry VIII.  In the medieval period, raw wool had been exported, but now England had an industry, based on its 11 million sheep. London and towns purchased wool from dealers, and send it to rural households where family labour turned it into cloth. They washed the wool, carded it and spun it into thread, which was then turned into cloth on a loom. Export merchants, known as
Merchant Adventurers
, exported woollens into the Netherlands and Germany, as well as other lands. The arrival of
Huguenots from France
brought in new skills that expanded the industry.
[22]
[23]
[24]
Government intervention proved a disaster in the early 17th century. A new company convinced Parliament to transfer to them the monopoly held by the old, well-established
Company of Merchant Adventurers
. Arguing that the export of unfinished cloth was much less profitable than the export of the finished product, the new company got Parliament to ban the export of unfinished cloth. There was massive dislocation marketplace, as large unsold quantities built up, prices fell, and unemployment rose. Worst of all, the Dutch retaliated and refused to import any finished cloth from England.  Exports fell by a third. Quickly the ban was lifted, and the Merchant Adventurers got its monopoly back.  However, the trade losses became permanent.
[25]
Diets
[
edit
]
Diet depended largely upon social class. The rich ate meat—beef, pork, venison and white bread; the poor ate coarse dark bread, with a little meat, notably at Christmas.
Game poaching
supplemented the diet of the rural poor.  Everyone drank
ale
or
cider
as water was often too impure to drink.
Fruits
and
vegetables
were seldom eaten. Rich spices were used by the wealthy to offset the smells of stale
salted meat
. The
potato
had yet to become part of the diet. The rich enjoyed desserts such as
pastries
,
tarts
,
cakes
, and crystallized fruit, and syrup.
[26]
Among the rich private hospitality was an important item in their budget. Entertaining a royal party for a few weeks could be ruinous to a nobleman.  Inns existed for travellers but restaurants were not known.
Both the rich and the poor had diets with nutritional deficiency. The lack of vegetables and fruits in their diets caused a deficiency in vitamin C, sometimes resulting in
scurvy
.
Trade and industry flourished in the 16th century, making England more prosperous and improving the standard of living of the upper and middle classes. However, the lower classes did not benefit much and did not always have enough food. As the English population was fed by its own agricultural produce, a series of bad harvests in the 1590s caused widespread distress.
[27]
In the 17th century the food supply improved. England had no food crises from 1650 to 1725, a period when France was unusually vulnerable to famines. Historians point out that oat and barley prices in England did not always increase following a failure of the wheat crop, but did so in France.
[28]
Poverty

]

About one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give

[29]
Tudor law was harsh on the
able-bodied poor
, those physically fit but unable to find work. Those who left their
parishes
in order to locate work were termed
vagabonds
and could be subjected to punishments, often suffering whipping and being put in the stocks. This treatment was inflicted to encourage them to return to their "mother parish."
[30]
[31]
18th century
[
edit
]
The trading nation
[
edit
]
The 18th century was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and
Daniel Defoe
boasted:
"We are the most diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."
[32]
While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg , Rurik dynasty  and Prussia's
House of Hohenzollern
), Britain had a different set of primary interests. Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers. This required a hegemonic
Royal Navy
so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles. The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the
Muscovy Company
set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included the
East India Company
, and the
Hudson's Bay Company
in Canada. The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the
Royal African Company
in 1672 and focused on the
Atlantic slave trade
. British involvement in each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade. Even the loss of the
Thirteen Colonies
was made up by a very favourable trading relationship with the new
United States of America
. Britain gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. Exports soared from £6.5 million in 1700, to £14.7 million in 1760 and £43.2 million in 1800.
[33]
Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasised trade as much as England.
[34]
[35]
Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India.
[36]
However, there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The
South Sea Bubble
was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The
South Sea Company
was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on
South America
. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to £31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from £130 a share to £1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king. His chief minister
Robert Walpole
managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.
[37]
[38]
The age of mercantilism
[
edit
]
Main article:
Mercantilism
The basis of the British Empire was founded in the age of
mercantilism
, an economic theory that stressed maximising the trade outside the empire, and trying to weaken rival empires. The 18th century British Empire was based upon the preceding
English overseas possessions
, which began to take shape in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the English settlement of islands of the
West Indies
such as
Trinidad and Tobago
, the
Bahamas
, the
Leeward Islands
,
Barbados
,
Jamaica
, and
Bermuda
, and of Virginia, one of the
Thirteen Colonies
which in 1776 became the United States, as well as of the
Maritime provinces
of what is now Canada. The
sugar plantation islands of the Caribbean
, where slavery became the basis of the economy, comprised England's most lucrative colonies. The American colonies also used
slave labour
in the farming of tobacco, indigo, and rice in the south. England, and later Great Britain's, American empire was slowly expanded by war and colonisation. Victory over the French during the
Seven Years' War
gave Great Britain control over what is now
eastern Canada
.
[39]
Mercantilism was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.
[40]
Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The
Navigation Acts
of the late 17th century provided the legal foundation for Mercantilist policy. They required all trade to be carried in English ships, manned by English crews (this later encompassed all Britons after the
Acts of Union 1707
united Scotland with England).
[41]
Colonists were required to send their produce and raw materials first of all to Britain, where the surplus was then sold-on by British merchants to other colonies in the British empire or bullion-earning external markets. The colonies were forbidden to trade directly with other nations or rival empires. The goal was to maintain the North American and Caribbean colonies as dependent agricultural economies geared towards producing raw materials for export to Britain. The growth of native industry was discouraged, in order to keep the colonies dependent on Britain for their finished goods.
[42]
The government had to fight smuggling—which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.
[43]
The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb
Royal Navy
, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured
New Amsterdam
(
New York City
) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.
[44]
Manufacturing
[
edit
]
Besides woollens, cotton, silk and linen cloth manufacturing became important after 1600, as did coal and iron.

Coalbrookdale
.
In 1709,
Abraham Darby I
established a
coke
-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the
Industrial Revolution
. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of
wrought iron
,
cast iron
, and
steel
until the 18th century.
[46]
The Industrial Revolution
[
edit
]
Main article:
Industrial Revolution
In period loosely dated from the 1770s to the 1820s, Britain experienced an accelerated process of economic change that transformed a largely agrarian economy into the world's first industrial economy. This phenomenon is known as the "
industrial revolution
", since the changes were far-reaching and permanent throughout many areas of Britain, especially in the developing cities.
[47]
Economic, institutional, and social changes were fundamental to the emergence of the industrial revolution. Whereas absolutism remained the normal form of governance through most parts of Europe, in the UK a fundamentally different power balance was created after the revolutions of 1640 and 1688. The new institutional setup ensured property rights and political safety and thereby supported the emergence of an economically prosperous middle class. Another factor is the change in marriage patterns through this period. Marrying later allowed young people to acquire more education, thereby building up more human capital in the population. These changes enhanced the already relatively developed labour and financial markets, paving the way for the industrial revolution starting in the mid-18th century.
[48]
Great Britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution.
[49]
Starting in the later part of the 18th century, there began a transition in parts of Great Britain's previously manual labour and draft-animal-based economy towards machine-based manufacturing. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of
iron-making
techniques and the increased use of
refined coal
. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of
canals
,
improved roads
and
railways
. Factories pulled thousands from low productivity work in agriculture to high productivity urban jobs.
[50]
The introduction of
steam power
fuelled primarily by coal, wider utilisation of
water wheels
and powered machinery (mainly in
textile manufacturing
) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal
machine tools
in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries. The effects spread throughout Western Europe and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting most of the world, a process that continues as
industrialisation
. The historian
Emma Griffin
has placed particular emphasis on the role of the steam engine in the making of Britain's industrial revolution.
[51]
According to
Max Weber
, the foundations of this process of change can be traced back to the Puritan Ethic of the
Puritans
of the 17th century.
[52]
This produced modern personalities attuned to innovation and committed to a work ethic, inspiring landed and merchant elites alive to the benefits of modernization, and a system of agriculture able to produce increasingly cheap food supplies. To this must be added the influence of religious nonconformity, which increased literacy and inculcated a "
Protestant work ethic
" amongst skilled artisans.
[53]
A long run of good harvests, starting in the first half of the 18th century, resulted in an increase in disposable income and a consequent rising demand for manufactured goods, particularly textiles. The invention of the

enabled wider cloth to be woven faster, but also created a demand for yarn that could not be fulfilled. Thus, the major technological advances associated with the industrial revolution were concerned with spinning.
James Hargreaves
created the
Spinning Jenny
, a device that could perform the work of a number of spinning wheels. However, while this invention could be operated by hand, the
water frame
, invented by
Richard Arkwright
, could be powered by a
water wheel
. Indeed, Arkwright is credited with the widespread introduction of the
factory system
in Britain, and is the first example of the successful mill owner and industrialist in British history. The water frame was, however, soon supplanted by the
spinning mule
(a cross between a water frame and a jenny) invented by
Samuel Crompton
. Mules were later constructed in iron by Messrs. Horrocks of Stockport.
As they were water powered, the first mills were constructed in rural locations by streams or rivers. Workers villages were created around them, such as
New Lanark
Mills in Scotland. These spinning mills resulted in the decline of the
domestic system
, in which spinning with old slow equipment was undertaken in rural cottages.
The
steam engine
was invented and became a power supply that soon surpassed waterfalls and horsepower. The first practicable steam engine was invented by
Thomas Newcomen
, and was used for pumping water out of mines. A much more powerful steam engine was invented by
James Watt
; it had a
reciprocating engine
capable of powering machinery. The first steam-driven textile mills began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, and this transformed the industrial revolution into an urban phenomenon, greatly contributing to the appearance and rapid growth of industrial towns.
The progress of the textile trade soon outstripped the original supplies of raw materials. By the turn of the 19th century, imported American cotton had replaced wool in the
North West of England
, though wool remained the chief textile in
Yorkshire
. Textiles have been identified as the catalyst in technological change in this period. The application of steam power stimulated the demand for coal; the demand for machinery and rails stimulated the
iron industry
; and the demand for transportation to move raw material in and finished products out stimulated the growth of the canal system, and (after 1830) the railway system.
Such an unprecedented degree of economic growth was not sustained by domestic demand alone. The application of technology and the factory system created such levels of
mass production
and cost efficiency that enabled British manufacturers to export inexpensive cloth and other items worldwide.
Walt Rostow
has posited the 1790s as the "take-off" period for the industrial revolution. This means that a process previously responding to domestic and other external stimuli began to feed upon itself, and became an unstoppable and irreversible process of sustained industrial and technological expansion.
In the late 18th century and early 19th century a series of technological advances led to the
Industrial Revolution
. Britain's position as the world's pre-eminent trader helped fund research and experimentation. The nation also had some of the world's greatest reserves of
coal
, the main fuel of the new revolution.
It was also fuelled by a rejection of mercantilism in favour of the predominance of
Adam Smith
's
capitalism
. The fight against Mercantilism was led by a number of
liberal
thinkers, such as
Richard Cobden
,
Joseph Hume
,
Francis Place
and
John Roebuck
.
Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British
slave trade
between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment, citing  "bigger markets for British goods, larger profits to British investors, more and cheaper raw materials for emerging industrial sectors, and more incentives for British consumers than were offered by domestic industries or other foreign markets".
[54]
The Industrial Revolution saw a rapid transformation in the British economy and society. Previously, large industries had to be near forests or rivers for power. The use of coal-fuelled engines allowed them to be placed in large urban centres. These new factories proved far more efficient at producing goods than the
cottage industry
of a previous era. These manufactured goods were sold around the world, and raw materials and luxury goods were imported to Britain.
Empire
[

Main articles:
British Empire
and
Historiography of the British Empire
During the Industrial Revolution the empire became less important and less well-regarded. The British defeat in the
American War of Independence
(1775-1783) deprived it of its largest and most developed colonies. This loss brought a realisation that colonies were not particularly economically beneficial to the home economy.
[55]
It was realised that the costs of occupation of colonies often exceeded the financial return to the taxpayer. In other words, formal empire afforded no great economic benefit when trade would continue whether the overseas political entities were nominally sovereign or not. The American Revolution helped demonstrate this by showing that Britain could still control trade with the colonies without having to pay for their defence and governance. This encouraged the British to grant their colonies self-government, starting with
Canada
, which became unified and largely independent in 1867, and
Australia
, which followed suit in 1901.
[56]
Napoleonic Wars
[
edit
]
See also:
French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
Critical to British success in confronting Napoleon was its superior economic situation. It was able to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating the
First French Empire
. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30 million. In terms of soldiers, the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.
[57]
Most important, the British national output remained strong. Textiles and iron grew sharply. Iron production expanded as demand for cannon and munitions was insatiable. Agricultural prices soared—it was a golden age for agriculture even as food shortages appeared here and there. There were riots in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset during the food shortages of 1800-01. Mobs forced merchants to hand over their stocks, as the food was distributed to the hungry by popular committees. Wells concludes that the disturbances indicate deep social grievances that extended far beyond the immediate food shortages.
[58]
Overall, however, crop production grew 50% between 1795 and 1815.
[59]
The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The well-organized business sector channelled products into what the military needed. Not only did British cloth provide for British uniforms, it clothed the allies as well and indeed the French soldiers too. Britain used its economic power to expand the Royal Navy, doubling the number of frigates and increasing the number of large ships of the line by 50%, while increasing the roster of sailors from 15,000 to 133,000 in eight years after the war began in 1793. France, meanwhile, saw its navy shrink by more than half.
[60]
The
national debt
of the United Kingdom was at a record high percentage of the GDP as the Napoleonic wars ended, but was largely repaid by 1914.
The British budget in 1814 reached £66 million, including £10 million for the Navy, £40 million for the Army, £10 million for the Allies, and £38 million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to £679 million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax.
[61]
The whole cost of the war came to £831 million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.
[62]

Long-term favourable impact
[
edit
]
O'Brien examines the long-term economic impact of the wars of 1793-1815, and finds them generally favourable, except for damage to the working class. The economy was not damaged by the diversion of manpower to the army and navy; in terms of destruction and enforced transfer of national wealth, Britain came out ahead. British control of the oceans proved optimal in creating a liberal free-trade global economy, and helped Britain gain the lion's share of the world's carrying trade and financial support services. The effects were positive for agriculture and most industries, apart from construction. The rate of capital formation was slowed somewhat and national income perhaps would have grown even faster without war. The most negative impact was a drop in living standards for the urban working classes.
[65]
19th century
[
edit
]
19th century Britain was the world's richest and most advanced economy while 19th century Ireland experienced the worst famine in Europe in that century.
[66]
Real GDP per person almost doubled in the 90 years between 1780 and 1870, when it reached $3263 per capita. This was one third greater than GDP per person in the United States, and 70% more than both France and Germany.
[67]
The economy was the most industrialized in the world, with one-third of the population employed in manufacturing by 1870 (concurrently one-sixth of the workforce in the United States was employed in manufacturing). The level of quantifiable steam power (in both industry and railroad travel), was gauged at 7,600
hp
in 1880, only excelled by the United States.
[68]
Urbanization was so intense that by 1901 80% of the British population lived in towns.
[69]
The number of towns with a population over 50,000 reached 32 between 1847 and 1850, double that of Germany and almost five times that of the United States.
[68]
By 1901 there were 74 British towns which met the 50,000 minimum threshold.
[69]
Free trade
[
edit
]
Tariff Rates (France, UK, US)
Free trade
was intellectually established by 1780 and implemented in the 1840s, thanks to the unusually strong influence of political theorists such as
Adam Smith
. They convincingly argued that the old policy of
mercantilism
held back the British economy, which if unfettered was poised to dominate world trade. As predicted, British dominance of world trade was apparent by the 1850s.
[70]
After 1840, Britain committed its economy to
free trade
, with few barriers or tariffs.
[71]
This was most evident in the repeal in 1846 of the
Corn Laws
, which had imposed stiff tariffs on imported grain. The end of these laws opened the British market to unfettered competition; grain prices fell, and food became more plentiful within Great Britain. The same was not true, however, in Ireland where the 1840s saw the worst famine in Europe in that century. By re-introducing income taxes in 1842 at the rate of 7 pence on the pound (or roughly 3%) for incomes over £150, the government of
Sir Robert Peel
was able to compensate for loss of revenue and repeal import duties on over 700 items.
[72]
From 1815 to 1870, Britain reaped the benefits of being the world's first modern, industrialised nation. It described itself as 'the workshop of the world', meaning that its finished goods were produced so efficiently and cheaply that they could often undersell comparable, locally manufactured goods in almost any other market.
[73]
If political conditions in a particular overseas market were stable enough, Britain could dominate its economy through free trade alone without having to resort to formal rule or mercantilism. Britain was even supplying half the needs in manufactured goods of such nations as Germany, France, Belgium, and the United States. By 1820, 30% of Britain's exports went to
its Empire
, rising slowly to 35% by 1910.
[74]
Until the latter 19th century, India remained Britain's economic jewel in terms of both imports and exports. In 1867, when British exports to her Empire totaled £50 million, £21 million of that was earned from India's market alone.
[75]
Second to India, but far behind, was Australia, whose imports from Britain totaled £8 million, followed by Canada (£5.8 million), Hong Kong (£2.5 million), Singapore (£2 million), and New Zealand (£1.6 million).
[75]
While these figures were undoubtedly significant, they represented just over a third of total British exports, the same proportion as over forty years before.
[75]
Apart from coal, iron, tin and
kaolin
most raw materials had to be imported so that, in the 1830s, the main imports were (in order): raw cotton (from the American South), sugar (from the West Indies), wool, silk, tea (from China), timber (from Canada), wine, flax, hides and tallow.
[76]
By 1900, Britain's global share had soared to 22.8% of total imports. By 1922, its global share was 14.9% of total exports and 28.8% of manufactured exports.
[77]
However, while in the 1890s Britain persisted in its free trade policy its major rivals, the U.S. and Germany, turned to high and moderately high tariffs respectively. American heavy industry grew faster than Britain and by the 1890s was competing with British machinery and other products in the world market.
[78]
In the decades before the First World War, Britain's exports were elastic to (increasing) foreign tariffs, with one study estimating that Britain's exports would have been 57% higher in 1902, under the counterfactual scenario of worldwide free trade.
[79]
Imperialism of Free Trade
[
edit
]
Main article:
The Imperialism of Free Trade
Historians agree that in the 1840s, Britain adopted a free-trade policy, meaning open markets and no tariffs throughout the empire.
[80]
The debate among historians involves what the implications of free trade actually were. "
The Imperialism of Free Trade
" is a highly influential 1952 article by
John Gallagher
and
Ronald Robinson
.
[81]
[82]
They argued that the
New Imperialism
of the 1880s, especially the
Scramble for Africa
, was a continuation of a long-term policy in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control. The article helped launch the
Cambridge School of historiography
. Gallagher and Robinson used the British experience to construct a framework for understanding European imperialism that swept away the
all-or-nothing thinking
of previous historians.
[83]
They found that European leaders rejected the notion that "imperialism" had to be based upon formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region. Much more important was informal influence in independent areas. According to Wm. Roger Louis, "In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red. The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire. Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'"
[84]
Oron Hale says that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they, "found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion. Cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made, usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerations."
[85]
Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated the impact. He says that Britain achieved its goal of increasing its economic interests in many areas, "but the broader goal of 'regenerating' societies and thereby creating regions tied as 'tributaries' to British economic interests was not attained." The reasons were:
the aim to reshape the world through free trade and its extension overseas owed more to the misplaced optimism of British policy-makers and their partial views of the world than to an understanding of the realities of the mid-19th century globe ... the volumes of trade and investment...the British were able to generate remained limited ... Local economies and local regimes proved adept at restricting the reach of British trade and investment.  Local impediments to foreign inroads, the inhabitants' low purchasing power, the resilience of local manufacturing, and the capabilities of local entrepreneurs meant that these areas effectively resisted British economic penetration.
[86]
Agriculture
[
edit
]
Further information:
Agriculture in the United Kingdom
A free market for imported foodstuffs, the driving factor behind the 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, reaped long-term benefits for consumers in Great Britain as world agricultural production increased.
[87]
Consumers in Ireland, where there was
severe famine
in the 1840s, did not benefit to the same extent. At first agriculture in Great Britain, through its superior productivity, was able to weather and even thrive following the repeal of the Corn Laws, contrary to the dire warnings of the landowners who had warned of immediate agricultural ruin. By the 1870s, the global price of grain began to fall dramatically following the opening up of the
Midwestern United States
and interior of
Canada
to mechanized cultivation. Combined with lower global transportation costs, the average price of a
quarter
of grain fell from 56
s
in the years 1867-71, to 27
s
3
d
per quarter in 1894-98.
[88]
[89]
This lowered the cost of living and enabled Britain to meet the demands of a quickly growing population (grain imports tripled in volume between 1870 and 1914, while the population grew 43% between 1871 and 1901).
[90]
[91]
[88]
It also caused the
Great Depression of British Agriculture
in the countryside by the late 1870s, where a series of bad harvests combined with the far cheaper price of foreign grain induced a long decline for the British agricultural sector. Wheat-producing areas like
East Anglia
were especially hard hit, with overall wheat cultivation down from 13% of agricultural output in 1870, to 4% in 1900.
[88]
Landowners argued for a re-introduction of the Corn Laws to protect domestic farming, but this was rebuffed by Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli
, who argued that returning to protectionism would endanger British manufacturing supremacy.
[92]
In addition to the general slump in demand, greater mechanization in British agriculture, typified by the introduction of steam-powered
threshing machines
, mowers, and reapers, increased unemployment for rural workers. The result was an acceleration of migration from country to town, where jobs in factories, domestic service, and other occupations offered better wages and more opportunities.
[93]
The male workforce of the countryside decreased by 40% between 1861 and 1901, while agriculture as a percentage of the national wealth fell from 20.3% in 1851 to just 6.4% by 1901.
[93]
The depression did not apply only to foodstuffs, but also to wool producers, a once vital sector undercut by a flood of cheap wool imports from
Australia
and
New Zealand
.
[88]
Only select types of produce where freshness was imperative, like milk and meat, enjoyed strong domestic demand in the late 19th century.
The declining profitability of agriculture in the latter decades of the 19th century left British landowners hard pressed to maintain their accustomed lifestyles. The connection between land ownership and wealth which had for centuries underpinned the
British aristocracy
began an inexorable decline. Rents fell some 26% between the mid-1870s and mid-1890s, just as the amount of land under cultivation fell some 19%.
[94]
88% of British millionaires between the years 1809-1879 were defined as landowners; the proportion fell to 33% in the years 1880-1914, as a new class of
plutocrats
emerged from industry and finance.
[95]
Recessions
[
edit
]
The Peterloo Massacre of 1819
Britain's 19th century economic growth was beset by frequent and sometimes severe recessions. The
Post-Napoleonic depression
following the end of the Wars in 1815 was induced by several years of poor harvests, which were aggravated by the
Corn Laws
of 1815. This law set high tariffs on imported foodstuffs, keeping the cost of grain artificially high while wages were declining.
[96]
[97]
As early as 1816, the high cost of grain caused famine and unrest in areas such as
East Anglia
and the North of England, where rioters seized grain stores and attacked the homes of suspected profiteers and merchants.
[98]
The high food prices caused an overall slump in consumption and consequently in industrial production and employment.
[99]
The discontent of the workers culminated in the disastrous confrontation with the authorities at the
Peterloo Massacre
of 1819, when British cavalry rode headfirst into a crowd of 60,000 to 80,000 protesters in
Manchester
, killing 5 and wounding as many as 700 people.
[100]
[101]
The recession of the "
Hungry Forties
" was similar in its nature to that of the 1820s. Like that of the years following 1815, the 1840s recession was caused by a series of bad harvests, this time from a blight affecting potatoes facilitated by unusually wet and cold conditions in Northern Europe. Ireland, where the population was heavily dependent on potatoes for subsistence, was the worst affected. On mainland Britain, regions of the
Scottish Highlands
and the
Outer Hebrides
were worst affected by the potato blight (some parts were depopulated by as much as 50%).
[102]
The
Corn Laws
inhibited the ability of the British government to import food for the starving in Ireland and Scotland, which led the Tory Prime Minister
Sir Robert Peel
to defy the landed interests in Parliament and force the abolition of the
Corn Laws
in June 1846. The abolition was only accomplished in phases through 1849, by which time Ireland and the Highlands had lost much of their populations to famine or emigration.
[103]
Relief funding by the British government for the famine in Ireland was dramatically cut in 1847 because of the financial crisis that year.
[104]
Many blamed the crisis on Peel's wider economic policy but the repeal of the
Corn Laws
, combined with the astronomic growth of the railways, served to lift Britain out of recession in the 1850s, providing the basis for steady growth in population and output over the next few decades.
[105]
Railways
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of rail transport in Great Britain 1830-1922
The British invented the modern railway system and exported it to the world. This emerged from Britain's elaborate system of canals and roadways, which both used horses to haul coal. Domestic consumption in household heaths remained an important market though coal also fired the new steam engines installed in textile factories.  Britain furthermore had the engineers and entrepreneurs needed to create and finance a railway system.  In 1815,
George Stephenson
invented the modern steam locomotive, launching a technological race: bigger, more powerful locomotives using higher and higher steam pressures. Stephenson's key innovation came when he integrated all the components of a railways
system
in 1825 by opening the
Stockton and Darlington
line. It demonstrated it was commercially feasible to have a system of usable length. London poured money into railway building—a veritable bubble, but one with permanent value.
Thomas Brassey
brought British railway engineering to the world, with construction crews that in the 1840s employed 75,000 men across Europe. Every nation copied the British model. Brassey expanded throughout the British Empire and Latin America. His companies invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges.
The
telegraph
, although invented and developed separately, proved essential for the internal communications of the railways. They allowed slower trains to pull over as express trains raced through; made it possible to use a single track for two-way traffic, and to locate where repairs were needed.
In the early period, recognition of the potential of the railways along with led to a period of speculation and investment referred to as
Railway Mania
. The boom years were 1836 and 1845-47, when Parliament authorized 8,000 miles of railways with a projected future total of £200 million; that about equalled one year of Britain's GDP. Once a charter was obtained, there was little government regulation, as laissez faire and private ownership had become accepted practices. Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914.
George Hudson
Isambard Kingdom Brunel
(1806-1859) designed the first major railway, the
Great Western
, built originally in the 1830s to cover the 100 miles from London to Bristol. Even more important was the highly controversial
George Hudson
. He became Britain's "railway king" by merging numerous short lines.
[106]
Since there was no government agency supervising the railways, Hudson set up a system that all the lines adopted called the
Railway Clearing House
. It made interconnections easy for people and freight by standardizing routines for transferring freight and people between companies, and loaning out freight cars. By 1849 Hudson controlled nearly 30% of Britain's trackage. Hudson did away with accountants and manipulated funds—paying large dividends out of capital because profits were quite low, but no one knew that until his system collapsed and the railway bubble of the late 1840s burst.
[107]
Euston station in London
, 1837. Note the open passenger carriages.
By 1850 Britain had a well integrated, well engineered system that provided fast, on-time, inexpensive movement of freight and people to every city and most rural districts. Freight rates had plunged to a penny a ton mile for coal. The system directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, conductors, mechanics, repairmen, accountants, station agents and managers, bringing a new level of business sophistication that could be applied to many other industries, and helping many small and large businesses to expand their role in the industrial revolution. Thus railways had a tremendous impact on industrialization. By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railway system itself. The system kept growing; by 1880, there were 13,500 locomotives which each carried 97,800 passengers a year, or 31,500 tons of freight.
[108]
Second Industrial Revolution
[
edit
]
Main article:
Second Industrial Revolution
During the First Industrial Revolution, the industrialist replaced the merchant as the dominant figure in the capitalist system. In the later decades of the 19th century, when the ultimate control and direction of large industry came into the hands of financiers,
industrial capitalism
gave way to
financial capitalism
and the corporation. The establishment of behemoth industrial empires, whose assets were controlled and managed by men divorced from production, was a dominant feature of this third phase. By the middle of the 19th century, as the world's only fully industrialized nation, British output represented just under half the total of the world's industrial capacity.
[75]
New products and services were also introduced which greatly increased international trade. Improvements in
steam engine
design and the wide availability of cheap iron (and after 1870 steel) meant that slow, sailing ships could be replaced with
steamships
, such as
Brunel's
SS Great Western
. Electricity and
chemical
industries became important although Britain lagged behind the U.S. and Germany.
Amalgamation of industrial
cartels
into larger corporations, mergers and alliances of separate firms, and technological advancement (particularly the increased use of electric power and
internal combustion engines
fuelled by petrol) were mixed blessings for British business during the late
Victorian era
. The ensuing development of more intricate and efficient machines along with mass production techniques greatly expanded output and lowered production costs. As a result, production often exceeded domestic demand. Among the new conditions, more markedly evident in Britain, the forerunner of Europe's industrial states, were the long-term effects of the severe
Long Depression
of 1873-1896, which had followed fifteen years of great economic instability. Businesses in practically every industry suffered from lengthy periods of low — and falling — profit rates and price deflation after 1873.
By the 1870s, financial houses in London had achieved an unprecedented level of control over industry. This contributed to increasing concerns among policy-makers over the protection of British investments overseas — particularly those in the securities of foreign governments and in foreign-government-backed development activities, such as railways. Although it had been official British policy to support such investments, with the large expansion of these investments in the 1860s, and the economic and political instability of many areas of investment (such as
Egypt
), calls upon the government for methodical protection became increasingly pronounced in the years leading up to the
Crystal Palace Speech
. At the end of the
Victorian era
, the
service sector
(banking, insurance and shipping, for example) began to gain prominence at the expense of manufacturing. During the late 18th century the United Kingdom experienced stronger increases in the service sector than in the industrial sector; industry grew by only 2 per cent, whereas the service sector employment increased by 9 per cent.
[109]
Foreign trade
[
edit
]
Canning Dock,
Liverpool
c. 1910, the "Second City" of the British Empire
Foreign trade tripled in volume between 1870 and 1914; most of the activity occurred with other industrialised countries.  Britain ranked as the world's largest trading nation in 1860, but by 1913 it had lost ground to both the United States and Germany: British and German exports in the latter year each totalled $2.3 billion, and those of the United States exceeded $2.4 billion. 
Although her own exports were diminishing in comparison to her rivals, Britain remained the world's largest trading nation by a significant margin: in 1914 her import and export totals were larger by a third compared to Germany, and larger by 50 per cent compared to the United States.
[110]
Britain was a top importer of foodstuffs, raw materials, and finished goods, much of which were re-exported to Europe or the United States.
[111]
In 1880 Britain purchased about half the world total in traded tea, coffee, and wheat, and just under half of the world's meat exports.
[112]
In that same year, more than 50 per cent of world shipping was British owned, while British shipyards were constructing about four fifths of the world's new vessels in the 1890s.
[113]
Its extensive trading contacts, investments in agriculture, and merchant shipping fleet enabled it to trade in a great volume of commodities remotely - transactions were concluded with foreign clients from London or other British cities over distant commodities like coffee, tea, cotton, rubber, and sugar.
Proportionally, even though trade volumes trebled between 1870 and 1914, the British share of the world market was actually shrinking. In 1880, 23 per cent of world trade was British-owned - by 1910 it was 17 per cent.
[114]
As foreign trade increased, so in proportion did the amount of it going outside the Continent. In 1840, £7.7 million of its export and £9.2 million of its import trade was done outside Europe; in 1880 the figures were £38.4 million and £73 million. Europe's economic contacts with the wider world were multiplying, much as Britain's had been doing for years. In many cases, colonial control followed private investment, particularly in raw materials and agriculture.
[115]
Intercontinental trade between North and South constituted a higher proportion of global trade in this era than in the late 20th century period of globalisation.
[116]
American invasion and British response
[
edit
]
The American "invasion" of some sections of the British home market for manufactured goods prompted a commercial response.
[117]
Tariffs, despite sustained political campaign for Protection in the first decade of the twentieth century, were only imposed generally after the collapse of the world trade in 1930. In this competitive milieu, British businessmen modernised their operations; for example, manufactures of boots and shoes faced increasing imports of American footwear and Americans entered the market for shoe-making machinery. British shoe-makers realised that to meet this competition it was necessary to re-examine their traditional methods of work, labour utilisation, and industrial relations; they also had to be more responsive to the demands of fashion.

City of London
The
City of London
strengthened its position as the world's financial capital, the export of capital was a major base of the British economy 1880 to 1913, the "golden era" of international finance.
[119]
[120]
[121]
By 1913 about 50% of capital investment throughout the world had been raised in London, making Britain the largest exporter of capital by a wide margin.
[122]
Although the British trade deficit widened (£27 million in 1851, by 1911 it was £134 million), earnings from investment and financial services more than closed the gap and generated a substantial Balance of Payments surplus.
[123]
Part of the reason for the initial boom in financial services was because manufacturing became less profitable beginning in the 1880s, due to the largely depressed world market of these years, combined with the expansion of manufacturing in the United States and Germany.
[114]
With foreign competition in some manufacturing sectors fiercer than in mid-century, British industrialists and financiers more profitably invested increasing quantities of capital abroad. In 1911, income from overseas investments amounted to £188 million; income from services like insurance, shipping, and banking totalled some £152 million.
[123]
It is indicative of the notable shift to financial services that between 1900 and 1913 total British investment abroad doubled, increasing from £2 billion to £4 billion.
[122]
[124]
In the late nineteenth century, Britain's foreign investment raised its merchandise exports to capital-receiving countries, since, at the time, Britain was both the world's workshop and the world's creditor.
[125]
British overseas investment was especially impressive in the independent nations of Latin America, which were eager for infrastructure improvements, such as railways and ports, that were often built by British contracting firms, and telegraph and telephone systems. Contemporaneously, British merchants dominated international trade in Latin America.
[126]
Inevitably, not all these investments paid off; for example, many British investors suffered substantial losses after investing in railway companies in the United States that went bankrupt, while even some mining ventures in the Sudan also proved unprofitable.
[127]
Business practices
[
edit
]
Big business grew much more slowly in Britain than in the United States, with the result that by the late 19th century the much larger American corporations were growing faster and could undersell the smaller competitors in Britain. A key was the
vertical integration
. In the United States, the typical firm expanded by reaching backward into the
supply chain
and forward into the distribution system. In the
Ford Motor Company
, raw iron and coal went in one end, and
Model Ts
were delivered by local dealers at the other end, British firms did not try to own the sources of raw materials, they bought on the market. Instead of setting up their own distribution system they worked with well-established wholesalers. The British businessmen were much more comfortable and a smaller niche, even though it made it much harder to lower costs and prices. Furthermore, the Americans had a rapidly growing home market, and Investment Capital was much more readily available. British businessmen typically used their savings not to expand their business but to purchase highly prestigious country estates - they looked to the landed country gentry for their role model, whereas Americans looked to the multi-millionaires. Crystal Palace hosted a world class industrial exhibition in 1851 in London. It was a marvelous display of the latest achievements in material progress, clearly demonstrating British superiority. The Americans were impressed, and repeatedly opened world-class industrial exhibits. By contrast, the British never repeated their success. In 1886 British sociologist
Herbert Spencer
commented: "Absorbed by his activities, and spurred on by his unrestricted ambitions, the American is a less happy being than the inhabitant of a country where the possibilities of success are very much smaller."
[128]
Organization
[
edit
]
As industrialisation took effect in the late 18th and early 19th century, the United Kingdom possessed a strong national government that provided a standard currency, an efficient legal system, efficient taxation, and effective support for overseas enterprise both within the British Empire and in independent nations. Parliament repealed medieval laws that restricted business enterprise, such as specification of how many threads could be in a woollen cloth, or regulating interest rates. Taxation fell primarily on landed wealth, not accumulated capital nor income. In 1825 Parliament repealed the
Bubble Act
of 1720 and facilitated
capital accumulation
. After the General Enclosure Act of 1801, farming became more productive and feed the growing urban industrial workforce.
[129]
The
Navigation Acts
remained important into the 1820s, and enforced by the Royal Navy, facilitated international trade. The road system was developed through government-sponsored local turnpikes. However, there were few examples of government-financed canals, and none of railroads, unlike early major transport projects in Japan, in Russia, or in the mid-nineteenth century USA.
[130]
Evidence from
Lever Brothers
,
Royal Dutch Shell
, and
Burroughs Wellcome
indicates that after 1870 individual entrepreneurship by top leaders was critical in fostering the growth of direct foreign investment and the rise to prominence of multinational corporations. In 1929, the first modern multinational company emerged when a merger of
Dutch Margarine Unie
and British soapmaker
Lever Brothers
resulted in
Unilever
.  With 250,000 people employed, and in terms of market value, Unilever was the largest industrial company in Europe.
[131]
However, after 1945 the importance of entrepreneurship declined in British business.
[132]
Accounting
[
edit
]
New business practices in the areas of management and accounting made possible the more efficient operation of large companies. For example, in steel, coal, and iron companies 19th-century accountants used sophisticated, fully integrated accounting systems to calculate output, yields, and costs to satisfy management information requirements.
[133]
South Durham Steel and Iron, was a large
horizontally integrated
company that operated mines, mills, and shipyards. Its management used traditional accounting methods with the goal of minimizing production costs, and thus raising its profitability. By contrast one of its competitors, Cargo Fleet Iron introduced mass production milling techniques through the construction of modern plants. Cargo Fleet set high production goals and developed an innovative but complicated accounting system to measure and report all costs throughout the production process. However, problems in obtaining coal supplies and the failure to meet the firm's production goals forced Cargo Fleet to drop its aggressive system and return to the sort of approach South Durham Steel was using.
[134]
Imperialism
[
edit
]
Further information:
Colonialism
After the loss of the American colonies in 1776, Britain built a "Second British Empire", based in colonies in India, Asia, Australia, Canada. The crown jewel was India, where in the 1750s a private British company, with its own army, the
East India Company
(or "John Company"), took control of parts of India. The 19th century saw Company rule extended across India after expelling the Dutch, French and Portuguese. By the 1830s the company was a government and had given up most of its business in India, but it was still privately owned. Following the
Indian Rebellion of 1857
the government closed down the company and took control of
British India
and the company's
Presidency Armies
.
[135]
Free trade (with no tariffs and few trade barriers) was introduced in the 1840s. Protected by the overwhelming power of the Royal Navy, the economic empire included very close economic ties with independent nations in Latin America. The informal economic empire has been called "
The Imperialism of Free Trade
."
[136]
Singapore docks in the 1890s
Numerous independent entrepreneurs expanded the Empire, such as
Stamford Raffles
of the East India Company who founded the port of
Singapore
in 1819. Businessmen eager to sell Indian opium in the vast China market led to the Opium War (1839-1842) and the establishment of British colonies at
Hong Kong
. One adventurer,
James Brooke
, set himself up as the Rajah of the
Kingdom of Sarawak
in North Borneo in 1842; his realm joined the Empire in 1888.
Cecil Rhodes
set up an economic empire of diamonds in South Africa that proved highly profitable. There were great riches in gold and diamonds but this venture led to expensive wars with the
Dutch settlers known as Boers
.
The possessions of the East India Company in India, under the direct rule of the Crown from 1857 —known as British India— was the centrepiece of the Empire, and because of an efficient taxation system it paid its own administrative expenses as well as the cost of the large
British Indian Army
.  In terms of trade, however, India turned only a small profit for British business.
[137]
However, transfers to the British government was massive: in 1801 unrequited (unpaid, or paid from Indian-collected revenue) was about 30% of British domestic savings available for capital formation in Britain.
[138]
[139]
There was pride and glory in the Empire, as talented young Britons vied for positions in the
Indian Civil Service
and for similar overseas career opportunities.
[140]
The opening of the
Suez Canal
in 1869 was a vital economic and military link. Britain continued to expand their control in areas strategically important to the link with India, including
Egypt
and
Cyprus
.
Cain and Hopkins argue that the phases of expansion abroad were closely linked with the development of the domestic economy. Therefore, the shifting balance of social and political forces under imperialism and the varying intensity of Britain's economic and political rivalry with other powers need to be understood with reference to domestic policies. Gentlemen capitalists, representing Britain's landed gentry and London's service sectors and financial institutions, largely shaped and controlled Britain's imperial enterprises in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Industrial leaders played a lesser role and found themselves dependent on the gentlemen capitalists.
[141]
[142]
Long Depression
[
edit
]
Main article:
Long Depression
The last and longest lasting of the 19th century recessions was the
Long Depression
, which began with the financial
Panic of 1873
and induced a twenty three-year period of worldwide anemic growth and recession cycles which only ended in the late 1890s. The bursting of a railroad speculation bubble in the United States, heavily financed via London, was a major factor in the initial shock. British foreign investment fell sharply, but it took some years for record high domestic investments to fall as well. The initial Depression lasted between 1873 and 1879, and was marked above all by price
deflation
, and therefore declining profitability for industrialists and financiers. Shrinking returns and a generally unfavorable economic climate meant that investment as a percentage of Britain's
National wealth
, both overseas and at home, fell from an average of 12.6% between 1870 and 1874, to 9.7% between 1875 and 1896.
[143]
The sluggish world market, which was at its weakest in the 1880s, was keenly felt in the export-reliant economy of the UK. British quinquennial export averages did not return to their pre-1873 levels (£235 million between 1870 and 1874) until 1895-99, slumping to £192 million in 1879. The recovery, moreover, was weaker than the mid-century growth in exports, because British manufactures were struggling to compete with domestically produced products in nations like Germany and the United States, where steep exclusionary tariffs had been enforced in response to the economic crisis.
[144]
[145]
Prices on commodities in Britain fell as much as 40% in the 1870s, with a downward pressure on wages which led to a general perception among the working classes of financial hardship and decline.
To a great extent, Britain's economic difficulties were symptomatic of structural weaknesses that were beginning to manifest themselves by the 1870s.
[67]
[146]
Economists have explained the relative slowdown in growth during the latter 19th century in terms of the
Neoclassical growth model
, in which the momentum from decades of growth was reaching an inevitable slow down.
[147]
Endogenous growth theory
suggests that this slowdown was attributable to national institutions and conditions, such as entrepreneurship, natural resources, and outward investment, rather than subject to a naturally occurring external model.
[148]
It is not surprising then, that countries with markedly larger natural resources, and larger populations to draw from, should have overtaken the UK in terms of production by the end of the nineteenth century. Britain depended on imports to supplement her deficiencies of some natural resources, but the high cost of shipping made this impracticable when competing against the resource-rich giant, the United States.
[149]
The result was clearly measured: the UK averaged 1.8% annual growth between 1873 and 1913, while the United States and Germany averaged 4.8% and 3.9% per annum respectively.
[150]
Historians have criticized cultural and educational factors for contributing to a decline in the "entrepreneurial spirit" which had characterized the Industrial Revolution. The offspring of first and second-generation industrialists in the late 19th-century, raised in privilege and educated at aristocratically dominated
public schools
, showed little interest in adopting their father's occupations because of the stigma attached to working in manufacturing or "trade".
[151]
[152]
Moreover, the curricula of the public schools and universities was overwhelmingly centered on the study of
Classics
, which left students ill-prepared to innovate in the manufacturing world. Many turned away from industry and entered the more "gentlemanly" financial sector, the law courts, or the civil service of the Empire.
[151]
However, the statistical evidence counters any of perception of economic stagnation in the latter 19th century: the employed labour force grew, unemployment in the years 1874-1890 only averaged 4.9%, and
productivity
continued to rise after the 1870s recession, albeit at a lower annual rate of 1%, compared to 2% in the years preceding the
Panic of 1873
. Moreover, because of the decline in prices overall, living standards improved markedly during the "Long Depression" decades.
[153]
[154]
Real GDP
per capita fluctuated by the year, but as a whole rose steadily from $3870 in 1873 to $5608 by 1900, exceeding all nations in terms of per capita wealth except Australia and the United States.
[155]
The heavy investment levels of pre-1873 began to yield returns, so that British income from abroad surpassed outward investment and created a steady surplus to support the widening
balance of trade
.
[156]
The export of capital investment, even though it occupied a smaller percentage of the national wealth, recovered briskly beginning in 1879, reaching record highs in the following decade (£56.15 million between 1876 and 1895, compared to £33.74 between 1851 and 1874).
[145]
The trend towards investing British capital abroad in the late 19th century (about 35% of British assets were held abroad by 1913) has been blamed for essentially starving native industry of investment which could have been used to maintain competitiveness and increase productivity.
[144]
[157]
One of the causes for the 1873 panic was attributed to overproduction in industry. British industrialists believed they had produced more than could be sold on saturated domestic and overseas markets, so they began to lobby the British government and public opinion to expand the
British Empire
.
[158]
According to this theory, Britain's trade deficit could be corrected, and excess production absorbed, by these new markets.
[159]
The result was the
Scramble for Africa
, the aggressive competition for territory between Britain and her European competitors which occurred in the 1880s.
1900-1945
[
edit
]
By 1900, the United States and Germany had experienced industrialisation on a scale comparable to that achieved in the United Kingdom and were also developing large-scale manufacturing companies; Britain's comparative economic advantage had lessened. The
City of London
remained the financial and commercial capital of the world, until challenged by New York after 1918.
1900-1914
[
edit
]
The
Edwardian era
(1901-1910) stands out as a period of peace and plenty. There were no severe depressions and prosperity was widespread. Britain's growth rate, manufacturing output, and GDP (but not GDP per capita) fell behind its rivals the United States, and Germany. Nevertheless, the nation still led the world in trade, finance and shipping, and had strong bases in manufacturing and mining.
[160]
Growth in the mining sector was strong and the coal industry played a significant role as the focus of the world's energy market; this prominence was to be challenged after the First World War by the growth of the oil industry and continuing development of the internal combustion engine. Although the relative contribution of the agricultural sector was becoming less important, productivity in the British agriculture sector was relatively high.
By international standards, and across all sectors of the United Kingdom, the British services sectors exhibited high labour factor productivity and, especially, total factor productivity; as was to be even more the case one hundred years later, it was the services sectors that provided the British economy's relative advantage in 1900.
It has been suggested that the industrial sector was slow to adjust to global changes, and that there was a striking preference for leisure over industrial entrepreneurship among the elite. In 1910, the British Empire's share of world industrial capacity stood at 15%, just behind Germany's 16%, and less than half of the United States' 35%.
[114]
Despite signs of relative weakness in certain sectors of the UK economy, the major achievements of the Edwardian years should be underlined. The city was the financial centre of the world—far more efficient and wide-ranging than New York, Paris or Berlin. British investment abroad doubled in the Edwardian years, from £2 billion in 1900 to £4 billion in 1913.
[122]
Britain had built up a vast reserve of overseas credits in its formal Empire, as well as in its informal empire in Latin America and other nations.  The British held huge financial holdings in the United States, especially in railways.  These assets proved vital in paying for supplies in the first years of the World War. Social amenities, especially in urban centres, were accumulating - prosperity was highly visible. Among the working class there was a growing demand for access to a greater say in government, but the level of industrial unrest on economic issues only became significant about 1908. In large part, it was the demands of the coal miners and railway workers, as articulated by their trade unions, that prompted a high level of strike activity in the years immediately before the First World War.
[161]
Labour Movement
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of trade unions in the United Kingdom
The rise of a powerful, concerted, and politically effective labour movement was one of the major socio-economic phenomena of the Edwardian years in the UK. Trade union membership more than doubled during this time, from 2 million people in 1901 to 4.1 million in 1913.
[162]
The
Labour Party
for the first time gained an active foothold in Parliament with the election of 30 Labour MPs in the
1906 General Election
, enabling greater advocacy for the interests of the working classes as a whole.
Striking dock workers in Liverpool gathered for a protest during the summer of 1911.
Inflation and stagnating wages began in 1908, which precipitated greater discontent among the working classes, particularly as the prosperity enjoyed by the middle and upper classes was becoming ever more visible.
[163]
In that year, strikes increased precipitously, mainly in the cotton and shipbuilding industries where job-cuts had occurred. In 1910, with unemployment reaching a record-low of 3 per cent, unions were emboldened by their
bargaining power
to make demands for higher wages and job stability. Strikes erupted throughout the nation - in the coal mining country of Wales and northeast England, the latter also experiencing a sustained railway workers' strike. In 1911 the
National Transport Workers' Federation
organized the first nationwide railway workers' strike, along with a general dockworker's strike in ports throughout the country.
[162]
In
Liverpool
, the summertime strikes of the dock and transport workers culminated in a series of conflicts with the authorities between 13 and 15 August, leading to the death of two men and over 350 injured.
[163]
[164]
In 1912 the
National coal strike
and another wave of transportation strikes cost the British economy an estimated 40 million working days.
[163]
The major demands of the labour movement during these years were wage-rises, a national minimum wage, and greater stability in employment.
[163]
The Liberal government in London did make some concessions in response to the demands of organized labour, most notably with the
Trade Boards Act 1909
, which empowered boards to set minimum wage requirements for workers, oversee working conditions, and limit working hours.
[165]
At first this applied to a very limited number of industries like lace-making and finishing, but in 1912 boards were created for the coal mining industry and within a few years all "sweated labour" occupations were overseen by such boards, guaranteeing minimum wages and safer work environments.
[166]
The coal strike of 1912 was so disruptive that the British government guaranteed a minimum wage for miners with separate legislation, the
Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act 1912
.
[163]
[167]
Tariff Reform
[
edit
]
A Tariff Reform poster from 1910, encouraging Protectionism over the Free Trade of the Victorian Era
In Edwardian Britain, proposals for more
protectionist
tariff policies which had begun in the 1890s became a mass political movement with high visibility.
[168]
The
Tariff Reform League
, founded in 1903 and headed by Britain's most outspoken champion of protectionism,
Joseph Chamberlain
, pushed for the implementation of tariffs to protect British goods in domestic and Imperial markets.
[169]
Tariff reformers like Chamberlain were worried by what was seen as a deluge of American and German products entering the domestic market; they argued that part of the reason for the success of the U.S. and German economies were the national tariffs each imposed to protect fledgling industries from foreign competition.
[168]
Without tariffs, it was claimed, vulnerable young industries like electrical goods, automobiles, and chemicals would never gain traction in Britain.
A major goal of the Tariff Reform League was the foundation of an Imperial Customs Union, which would create a closed trade bloc in the British Empire and, it was hoped, fully integrate the economies of Britain and her overseas possessions.
[170]
Under such an arrangement, Britain would maintain a reciprocal relationship whereby she would purchase raw materials from her colonies, the profits of which would allow them to buy finished goods from Britain, enriching both sides.
[169]
Although it was a highly publicized and well-funded campaign, Tariff Reform never gained traction with the public at large. The defeat of Chamberlain's
Liberal Unionist Party
in the
1906 General Election
, which returned a huge majority for free-trade stalwarts in the Liberal and Labour parties, was a resounding blow to the movement's electoral hopes, although the campaign itself persisted through the rest of the Edwardian period.

First World War

Further information:
History of the United Kingdom during the First World War
and
Economic history of World War I § Britain
The
First World War
saw a decline of economic production, with a major reallocation to munitions. It forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from the U.S.
[171]
Because of its prime importance in international finance, the entry of the UK into the war in August 1914 threatened a possible worldwide liquidity crisis. In Britain itself, there were fears of a
run on the banks
, which prompted the Treasury to take inflationary measures and begin printing 5 million new banknotes a day.
[172]
To assuage nervous markets, a one-month
moratorium
on payments was declared, while the
Bank of England
agreed to guarantee the City of London's
bills of exchange
and to act as underwriter for London's
Clearing houses
.
[172]
Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining her productivity. The financing was generally successful,
[173]
as the city's strong financial position minimized the damaging effects of inflation, as opposed to much worse conditions in Germany.
[174]
Spending by the UK in the US, on everything from food to munitions, occupied 40% of total British war expenditure by 1916.
[175]
The banking house
J.P. Morgan & Co.
won a concession in January 1915 to act as the sole purchasing agent for the Admiralty and War Department in the United States. $20 billion worth of trade was undertaken in this way by the end of 1916. Until February 1917, J.P. Morgan was also Britain's agent for all dollar loans raised in the United States.
[175]
Overall consumer consumption declined 18% from 1914 to 1919.
[176]
To raise vital funds for the war effort, taxation also increased dramatically. Whereas before the war the majority of tax revenue was derived from indirect taxation, by 1920 60% of tax revenue was from income and "super tax" levies, like the one imposed on incomes over £10,000.
[177]
Income tax had stood at just 6% before the war and only applied to 1.13 million Britons, by 1920 there were 3 million income tax payers at a rate of 30%.
[178]
Britain also exploited its imperial resources to raise capital: India's 1917 excess export earnings were appropriated through a
gift
of £100 million to the British war effort.
[179]
In 1918 another £45 million was appropriated to support the war.
[180]
Trade unions were encouraged as membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.
[181]
In Scotland, the shipbuilding industry expanded by a third.
[182]
Women were available and many entered munitions factories and took other home front jobs vacated by men.
[183]
Interwar stagnation
[
edit
]
Further information:
Interwar Britain
The human and material losses of the World War in Britain were enormous.  They included 745,000 servicemen killed and 24,000 civilians, with 1.7 million wounded. The total of lost shipping came to 7.9 million tons (much of it replaced by new construction), and £7,500 million in financial costs to the Empire. Germany owed billions in reparations, but Britain in turn owed the U.S. billions in loan repayments.
[184]
In 1919-1920 there was a short-lived boom in the British economy, caused by a rush of investment pent-up during the war years and another rush of orders for new shipping to replace the millions of tons lost.
[185]
However, with the end of war orders, a serious depression hit the economy by 1921-22. Exports fell to half of their 1913 levels, and unemployment peaked at 17%.
[185]
Factors explaining the economic depression are on one hand the return to prewar gold standard at parity or upcoming structural problems to the northern industrial core of the UK.
[186]
Another factor contributing to the relative decline of British industry during the 1920s was the loss of Britain's export markets, mostly in the Far East and Latin America. The diversion of shipping and production towards the war effort between 1914 and 1918 meant that regional producers like the United States in Latin America or Japan in the Far East usurped important markets for British goods.
[185]
Britain never regained its pre-1914 export volumes, by 1929 exports were still only 80% of what they had been in 1913.
[187]
Indeed, even if Britain was far better off compared to the badly battered Continent, economic stagnation lasted the whole decade.
[188]
Overall growth averaged 1.8% per annum during the 1920s, slightly weaker but comparable to the United States.
[185]
Slow growth was due in part to Britain's heavy dependence on exports, and world trade grew sluggishly through the 1920s.
[185]
It was also overly dependent on so-called "staple" industries, those which had brought huge prosperity in the 19th century but by the 1920s were experiencing faltering demand and strong competition from abroad. In 1922, for example, the volume of cotton exports was only about half of what it had been in 1913, while coal exports were only one third of their 1913 levels.
[185]
The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.
[189]
In depressed areas the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.
[190]
Productivity and employment
[
edit
]
Main article:
Interwar unemployment and poverty in the United Kingdom
In 1919, Britain reduced the working hours in major industries to a 48-hour week for industrial workers. Historians have debated whether this move depressed labour productivity and contributed to the slump. Scott and Spadavecchia argue that productivity was in some ways enhanced, especially through higher hourly productivity, and that Britain did not suffer in its exports because most other nations also reduced working hours. Looking at coal, cotton, and iron and steel, they find that Britain did not suffer any significant relative productivity loss in these industries.
[191]
By 1924 workers had regained their productive output of 1913, this while working greatly reduced hours compared to the pre-war years.
[192]
By 1938 British industrial productivity had increased by 75% compared to pre-1914 levels, even after the setbacks of reduced working hours and the effects of the Great Depression were taken into account.
[192]
Monetary policy of postwar governments also contributed to high unemployment. By April 1925, years of stringent
deflationary
policies by the British Exchequer had accomplished the intended goal of returning the Pound Sterling to its pre-war exchange rate of $4.86. This high exchange rate made for cheap consumer prices and a high
real wage
for UK workers. However, interest rates were also high as a result, making the cost of doing business all the more expensive, while high labour costs were inevitably offset by employers with layoffs and reduced hiring.
[193]
By 1921, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed as a result of the postwar economic downturn. While the economy was recovering by 1922-1923, the UK found itself struggling again by 1926, the
general strike
of that year doing it no favours. Growth for the remainder of the decade became erratic, with brief periods of stagnation constantly interrupting growth. Industrial relations briefly improved, but then came the
Wall Street stock market crash
in October 1929, which sparked the worldwide
Great Depression
(See the
Great Depression in the United Kingdom
).
[194]
Unemployment had stood at less than 1.8 million at the end of 1930, but by the end of 1931 it had risen sharply to more than 2.6 million.
[195]
By January 1933, more than 3 million Britons were unemployed, accounting for more than 20% of the workforce - with unemployment topping 50% in some parts of the country, particularly in
South Wales
and the north-east of
England
. The rest of the 1930s saw a moderate economic recovery stimulated by private housing. The rate of unemployment fell to 10% in 1938 - half of the level five years previously.
[196]
Steel
[
edit
]
From 1800 to 1870, Britain produced more than half of the world's pig iron, and its ironmasters continued to develop new steel making processes. In 1880, Britain produced 1.3 million tons of steel, 3 million tons in 1893 and by 1914 output was 8 million tons. Germany caught up in 1893 and produced 14 million tons in 1914.
[197]
After 1900, as the U.S. became the world's leading steel producing economy, British metallurgists pioneered the commercial development of special steels. Academic experts, such as Professor Oliver Arnold led research into the development of phospho-magnetic steels and other specialised high-strength alloys, using the electric furnace and other innovations, as well as reducing smoke pollution. The industry trained a cadre of experts that made large firms scientifically progressive.
[198]
The leaders of the world's leading iron and steel companies continued to look to the London-based Iron and Steel Institute for the dissemination of cutting-edge scientific and technical research.
Coal
[

Main article:
Coal mining in the United Kingdom
Politics became a central issue for the coal miners who contributed significantly to the growth of the labour and co-operative movements in major industrial centres such as
South Yorkshire
(including
Sheffield
), the
West Midlands
(the
Black Country
),
Bristol
, the
Valleys of South Wales
(
Merthyr Tydfil
) and the
Central Lowlands
of Scotland (
Paisley
); while some rural coal-mining communities could be insular, they also provided the bedrock of the Britain's industrial regions by providing locally produced fuel. 1888 saw the formation of an overarching national organisation for the hitherto regionally based miners' unions, and by 1908 The
Miners' Federation of Great Britain
had 600,000 members. Many of the policies associated with the Labour Party's 'old left' had roots in coal-mining areas; in particular, the
nationalisation
of the coal industry.
[199]
General Strike of 1926
[
edit
]
Main article:
1926 United Kingdom general strike
The Spring of 1926 saw the British government refuse to extend again the subsidy that had bought short-term peace for the coal industry. In April 1926 the owners locked out the miners when they rejected the coal mine owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay. The backdrop to the dispute was a fall in the price of coal, an important element of the general
deflationary
tendency after the end of the
First World War
which was exacerbated by the adoption of fuel oil in place of coal.
[200]
The general strike was led by the
Trades Union Congress
in support of the coal miners, but it failed. It was a nine-day nationwide walkout of one million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, ironworkers and steelworkers supporting the 1.5 million coal miners who had been locked out. The government had continued existing subsidies for an additional nine-months subsidy in 1925 seeking to achieve short-term peace in the coal industry. The TUC hope was the government would intervene to reorganise and rationalise the industry, and raise the subsidy. The
Conservative government
had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only
general strike
in British history and TUC leaders such as
Ernest Bevin
considered it a mistake. Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but
Martin Pugh
says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.
[201]
[202]
The
Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927
made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946.
Coal continued as industry in slow decline as the best seams were used up and it became more and more difficult to mine the residue. The Labour government in 1947 nationalised coal with the creation of
National Coal Board
, giving miners access to control of the mines via their control of the Labour party and the government.
[203]
By then, however, the best seams had played out and coal mining was headed downward.  Coal production was 50 million metric tons in 1850, 149 million in 1880, 269 million in 1910, 228 million in 1940, and 153 million in 1970.  The peak year was 1913, with an output of 292 million tons. Mining employed 383,000 men in 1851, 604,000 in 1881, and 1,202,000 in 1911; on the eve of the First World War in the United Kingdom ten workers, one was a coal miner.
[204]
New industries
[
edit
]
While Britain remained overly dependent on 'staple' heavy industries, the First World War had the advantage of stimulating production in new industries where the UK had lagged behind before 1914. Several of the new industries, including motorcars, chemicals, and rayon, were early recipients of tariff protection in the 1920s, prior to the
Import Duties Act 1932
.
[205]
The interwar years saw new technologies develop at a breakneck pace, creating lucrative new industries including automobile, airplane, and motorbike manufacture. Before the First World War, automobile manufacture in Britain had been a boutique industry limited to producing expensive luxury cars. The industry produced 34,000 vehicles for the year 1913; by 1937 over half a million were being produced.
[192]
Most of these were affordable models like the
Austin 7
(introduced 1921), the
Morris Minor
(1928), as well as Model A and
Model Y
cars produced by
Ford of Britain
. The adoption of streamlined automation processes and the strong competition between manufacturers was responsible for a 50% drop in motorcar prices between the mid 20s and mid 30s, making cars more affordable (over 1 million were owned by 1930).
[206]
[207]
The chemicals industry, once dominated by Germany and the United States, also thrived in the UK during the interwar years. By 1939 it employed 100,000 people and produced fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and synthetic materials.
[208]
Electrical engineering also mushroomed: the establishment of the
Central Electricity Board
in 1926 enabled a nationwide high-voltage electrical grid to be developed. By 1939 two thirds of homes had electricity supply, which in turn opened up a new consumer market for electrically powered appliances like vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, radios and stoves.
[192]
Between 1923 and 1938, the most successful new industries were: automobile production, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, metal goods, and printing. These created a net total of 557,920 new jobs between 1923 and 1938, some 96% of all new industrial jobs created in the interwar period.
[209]
These industries were overwhelmingly concentrated in the communities surrounding London and cities in the
West Midlands
, particularly
Coventry
and Birmingham, where there was an established workforce skilled in the production of high quality metal goods.
[209]
1920s "consumer boom"
[
edit
]
In spite of the serious problems that plagued heavy industry, the 1920s marked an era of unprecedented growth for the British consumer industry, until then a minor player in the national economy. While not creating a fully-fledged "consumer culture" as in the United States during the same decade, it had an important effect over British society, primarily on the middle classes which gained access to commodities previously reserved for the upper crust, primarily automobiles, ownership rising tenfold during the interwar period (from around 500,000 in 1919 to approximately over 3 million in 1929 and 5 million in 1939). Sales of electric appliances boomed thanks to the rise of consumer-oriented credit and loans. Higher wages and shorter working hours also led to the rise of recreation: Gramophone records, radio (or "the wireless" as it was referred), magazines and cinema became part of everyday life much like sports, primarily football and cricket.
Tourism grew rapidly in the interwar years because of the rapidly rising number of motorized middle-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers, as well as an influx of American tourists. Seaside resorts like
Blackpool
,
Brighton
and
Skegness
were particularly popular. However, those tourist sites that catered to the very wealthy (which now began holidaying abroad) or were located in depressed areas, all experienced a decline in profits, especially during the Great Depression.
[210]
Electricity, gas, plumbing and telephone services became common as well during the decade, even in some working class households. However, those living in the most remote and poorest parts of Britain saw little change in their living standards, with many Britons still living in terraced homes with outdoor toilets as late as the 1960s.
1929-1939: the Great Depression
[
edit
]
Main article:
Great Depression in the United Kingdom
Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930
While the
Wall St Crash
of 1929 had little direct impact on the British stock market, the collapse of the American economy which it had foretold and the associated contraction of world trade seriously affected Britain in the early 1930s. Whereas British politicians had championed the concept of the free market when it was ascendant in the world economy, it gradually withdrew to adopting
Tariff Reform
as a measure of protectionism. In 1933 Sterling left the
Gold Standard
. By the early 1930s, the depression again signalled the economic problems the British economy faced. Unemployment soared during this period; from just over 10% in 1929 to more than 20% (or more than 3 million of the workforce) by early 1933. However, it had fallen to 13.9% by the start of 1936. While heavy industry sank to new lows, the consumer industry recovered by 1934 and production increased by 32% between 1933 and 1937. A good indication of the strong consumer market was the growth of retailers during the 1930s.
Marks & Spencer
, for example, increased its turnover from £2.5 million in 1929 to over £25 million in 1939, necessitating the opening of dozens of new locations to serve the burgeoning demand in the suburbs.
[185]
In 1929
Ramsay MacDonald
formed his second minority
Labour Party
government. In political terms, the economic problems found expression in the rise of radical movements who promised solutions which conventional political parties appeared unable to provide. In Britain this was seen with the rise of the
Communist Party of Great Britain
(CPGB) and the
British Union of Fascists
under
Oswald Mosley
. However, their political strength was limited and unlike in the rest of Europe, the conventional political parties did not face a significant challenge. In 1931 the
Labour Government
resigned having failed to agree cuts in national expenditure, disagreeing over the extent of cuts in welfare payments, to be
replaced
by a McDonald-led
National Government
. The
Conservative Party
, which provided the majority of its MPs, was returned to power in the
1935 general election
.
Second World War
[
edit
]
Further information:
United Kingdom home front during World War II
and
Home front during World War II
In the
Second World War
, 1939-45, Britain had a highly successful record of mobilising the
home front
for the war effort, in terms of mobilising the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximising output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people.
[211]
Much of this success was due to the systematic planned mobilisation of women, as workers, soldiers, and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription.
[212]
The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success.

Surrey Docks
, after a destructive night-time bombing raid by the

Industrial production was reoriented toward munitions, and output soared. In steel, for example, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs of civilian departments and the war effort, but strategic considerations received precedence over any other need.
[213]
Highest priority went to aircraft production as the RAF was under continuous heavy German pressure. The government decided to concentrate on only five types of aircraft in order to optimize output. They received extraordinary priority. Covering the supply of materials and equipment and even made it possible to divert from other types the necessary parts, equipment, materials and manufacturing resources. Labour was moved from other aircraft work to factories engaged on the specified types. Cost was not an object. The delivery of new fighters rose from 256 in April to 467 in September 1940—more than enough to cover the losses—and
RAF Fighter Command
emerged triumphantly from the
Battle of Britain
in October with more aircraft than it had possessed at the beginning.
[214]
Starting in 1941 the U.S. provided munitions through Lend lease that totalled $15.5 billion.
[215]
After war broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, Britain imposed
exchange controls
. The British Government used its
gold reserves
and dollar reserves to pay for munitions, oil, raw materials and machinery, mostly from the U.S. By the third quarter of 1940 the volume of British exports was down 37% compared to 1935. Although the British Government had committed itself to nearly $10,000 million of orders from America, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were near exhaustion. The Roosevelt Administration was committed to large-scale economic support of Britain and in early 1941 enacted
Lend-Lease
, whereby America would give Britain supplies totalling $31.4 billion which never had to be repaid.

Although Britain achieved ultimate victory in the war, the economic costs were enormous.
[217]
[218]
Six years of prolonged warfare and heavy losses of merchant shipping meant that Britain had lost two-thirds of her pre-war export trade by 1945.
[219]
The loss of her export markets also caused a serious shortage of US dollars, which were crucial to servicing Britain's war debt and maintaining imports from the United States. Most of Britain's gold and currency reserves were depleted and the Government had been forced to sell off the bulk of British overseas assets to fund the war effort.
[219]
When
Lend Lease
was terminated by the United States in August 1945, Britain was unable to pay for the import of essential supplies from America. Although the US agreed to cancel $20 million in Lend Lease debt, the UK was forced to obtain a $3.75 billion loan from the United States at 2% interest in December 1945.
[220]
The US/UK trade imbalance was perilously high, forcing the extension of rationing to lessen the imbalance and preserve precious
US dollars
for the servicing of loan repayments.
[221]
Successive governments squandered billions of
Marshall Plan Aid
to support British world power pretensions, and so jeopardised the economic future of Britain. The
Labour government
chose not to use the $2.7 billion (Germany received $1.7b) in aid for industrial modernization like
West Germany
had.

By 1950-1 the UK still spent 7.7% of GNP on defence while Germany and Japan spent nothing.
[222]
In the
1945 general election
, just after the end of the war in Europe, the
Labour Party
led by
Clement Attlee
was elected with a landslide majority (its first ever outright majority), introducing sweeping reforms of the British economy. Taxes were increased, industries were nationalised, and the
welfare state
with the
National Health Service
, pensions, and social security was expanded.
[223]
Most rations were lifted by 1950, with a few of them remaining until 1954.
The next 15 years saw some of the most rapid growth Britain had ever experienced, recovering from the devastation of the Second World War and then expanding rapidly past the previous size of the economy. The economy went from strength to strength particularly after the Conservatives returned to government in 1951, still led by wartime leader
Sir Winston Churchill
until he retired to make way for
Anthony Eden
just before his party's
re-election in 1955
. However, the Suez crisis of 1956 weakened the government's reputation and Britain's global standing, and prompted Eden to resign in early 1957 to be replaced by
Harold Macmillan
.
By 1959, tax cuts had helped boost living standards and allow for a strong economy
[224]
and low unemployment, with October 1959 seeing the Tories win their third consecutive general election with a greatly increased majority, which sparked public and media doubt regarding Labour's chances of future election success.
[225]
Labour leader
Hugh Gaitskell
then drew a new economic plan for the party, heavily based on the success of the centralised industries of France and West Germany, by the 1960s the latter's economy surpassing the UK for the first time since 1915 as Europe's largest economy.
Harold Wilson
and
Anthony Wedgwood Benn
further developed the idea, becoming the backbone of the party's manifesto for the 1964 election.
Britain's economy remained strong with low unemployment into the 1960s, but towards the end of the decade this growth began to slow and unemployment was rising again.
Harold Wilson
, the Labour leader who had ended 13 years of Conservative rule with a narrow victory in
1964
before increasing his majority in
1966
, was surprisingly voted out of power in
1970
. The
new Conservative government
was led by
Edward Heath
.
During the 1970s Britain suffered a long running period of relative economic malaise, dogged by rising unemployment, frequent strikes and severe inflation, with neither the
Conservative
government of
1970
-
1974
(led by
Edward Heath
) nor the
Labour
government which succeeded it (led by
Harold Wilson
and from 1976
James Callaghan
) being able to halt the country's economic decline. Inflation exceeded 20% twice during the 1970s and was rarely below 10%.
Unemployment exceeded 1 million by 1972 and had risen even higher by the time the end of the decade was in sight, passing the 1.5 million mark in 1978. The winter of 1978/79 brought a series of public sector strikes known as the
Winter of Discontent
, leading to the collapse of Callaghan's Labour government in March 1979 (two years after it had lost the three-seat parliamentary majority won in October 1974).
[225]
This led to the election of
Margaret Thatcher
, who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in 1975. She cut back on the government's role in the economy and weakened the power of the
trade unions
. The final two decades of the 20th century saw an increase in service-providers and a drop in manufacturing and heavy industry, combined with
privatisation
of some sections of the economy.
1945-1951: Age of Austerity
[
edit
]
After the end of World War II, the British economy had again lost huge amounts of absolute wealth. Its economy was driven entirely for the needs of war and took some time to be reorganised for peaceful production. Britain's economic position was relatively strong compared to its devastated European neighbors - in 1947 British exports were equivalent in value to the combined exports of
France
,
West Germany
,
Italy
,
Norway
,
Denmark
,
Belgium
, the
Netherlands
, and
Luxembourg
.
[226]
Anticipating the end of the conflict, the
United States
had negotiated throughout the war to liberalise post-war trade and the international flow of capital in order to break into markets which had previously been closed to it, including the British Empire's
Pound Sterling bloc
. This was to be realised through the
Atlantic Charter
of 1941, through the establishment of the
Bretton Woods system
in 1944, and through the new economic power that the US was able to exert due to the weakened British economy.

Immediately after the war in the Pacific ended, the U.S. halted
Lend-Lease
, but did give the UK a
long-term low-interest loan of US$4.33bn
. The winter of
1946-1947
proved to be very harsh, with curtailed production and shortages of coal, which again affected the economy so that by August 1947, when convertibility was due to begin, the economy was not as strong as it needed to be. When the Labour Government enacted convertibility, there was a run on Sterling, as pounds were traded for dollars. This damaged the British economy and within weeks convertibility was abandoned. By 1949, the British pound was seen to be overvalued; it was devalued on 18 September 1949 from £1 at $4.03 to $2.80. The US dollar had become the world's premier currency.
The major economic priority of post-war Britain was to raise exports to fund the UK's dollar deficit. This required the extension of rationing, as British goods and produce were prioritized for export markets. Unlike Continental European countries, where rationing was abandoned within a few years of the wars' end, Britain actually tightened rationing restrictions and didn't fully abandon them until 1954.
[227]
The U.S. began
Marshall Plan
grants (mostly grants with a few loans) that pumped $3.3 billion into the economy and encouraged businessmen to modernize their approach to management.
[228]
Marshall Aid, however, failed to have the desired effect of modernizing industry and stimulating the economy, because 97% of the funds were used to service British debt repayments. This left the UK at a comparative disadvantage to rivals like
France
and
West Germany
, who were able to invest the money directly into industry and infrastructure, creating more competitive, efficient economies in the long-term.
[229]
Nationalisation
[
edit
]
The Labour Governments of 1945-1951 enacted a political programme rooted in
collectivism
that included the
nationalisation
of industries and state direction of the economy. Both wars had demonstrated the possible benefits of greater state involvement. This underlined the future direction of the post-war economy, and was also supported in the main by the Conservatives. However, the initial hopes for nationalisation were not fulfilled and more nuanced understandings of economic management emerged, such as state direction, rather than state ownership. With the extensive nationalisation programme achieved, Keynesian management of the UK economy was adopted.
With the postwar Labour Governments, the first comprehensive attempts at economic planning were made with initiatives intended to overhaul chronically depressed regions of the UK. The
Distribution of Industry Act 1945
designated "development areas" in northeast England, Scotland, and Wales according to the findings of the Barlow Report of 1940, which had recommended a complete economic overhaul of the troubled areas it pinpointed.
[230]
Between 1945 and 1950, the British government pumped some £300 million into the building of 481 new factories in these regions, to be leased to private industry. In addition there were 505 privately owned factories built in the troubled regions on the active encouragement of the government in London. This activity created an estimated 200,000 new jobs.
[231]
The policy of nationalising the coal mines had been accepted in principle by owners and miners alike before the elections of 1945. The owners were paid £165,000,000. The government set up the
National Coal Board
to manage the coal mines; and it loaned it £150,000,000 to modernise the system. The general condition of the coal industry had been unsatisfactory for many years, with poor productivity. In 1945, there were 28% more workers in the coal mines than in 1890, but the annual output was only 8% greater. Young people avoided the pits; between 1931 and 1945 the percentage of miners more than 40 years old rose from 35% to 43%, and 24,000 over 65 years old. The number of surface workers decreased between 1938 and 1945 by only 3,200, but in that same time the number of underground workers declined by 69,600, substantially altering the balance of labour in the mines. That accidents, breakdowns, and repairs in the mines were nearly twice as costly in terms of production in 1945 as they had been in 1939 was probably a by-product of the war. Output in 1946 averaged 3,300,000 tons weekly. By summer 1946 it was clear that the country was facing a coal shortage for the upcoming winter with stock piles of 5 million tons too low. Nationalisation exposed both a lack of preparation for public ownership and a failure to stabilize the industry in advance of the change. Also lacking were any significant incentives to maintain or increase coal production to meet demand.
[232]
Prosperity of the 1950s
[
edit
]
The 1950s and 1960s were prosperous times and saw continued modernisation of the economy.
[233]
Representative was the construction of the first
motorways
, for example. Britain maintained and increased its financial role in the world economy, and used the English language to promote its educational system to students from around the globe. Unemployment was relatively low during this period, and the standard of living continued to rise, with more new private and council housing developments and the number of slum properties diminishing. Churchill and the Conservatives were back in power following the 1951 elections, but they largely continued the welfare state policies as set out by the Labour Party in the late 1940s.

, Wales in the 1950s. Holiday camps symbolized the newfound prosperity and leisure of postwar Britain.
During the "golden age" of the 1950s and 1960s, unemployment in Britain averaged only 2%. As prosperity returned, Britons became more family centred.
[234]
Leisure activities became more accessible to more people after the war.
Holiday camps
, which had first opened in the 1930s, became popular holiday destinations in the 1950s - and people increasingly had the money to pursue their personal hobbies. The
BBC
's early television service was given a major boost in 1952 with the coronation of
Elizabeth II
, attracting a worldwide audience of twenty million, plus tens of millions more by radio, proving an impetus for middle-class people to buy televisions. In 1950, just 1% owned television sets; by 1965 25% did. As austerity receded after 1950 and consumer demand kept growing, the Labour Party hurt itself by shunning consumerism as the antithesis of the socialism it demanded.
[235]
Small neighbourhood shops were increasingly replaced by
chain stores
and
shopping centres
, with their wide variety of goods, smart advertising, and frequent sales. Cars were becoming a significant part of British life, with city-centre congestion and
ribbon developments
springing up along many of the major roads. These problems led to the idea of the
green belt
to protect the countryside, which was at risk from development of new housing units.
[236]
The post-World War II period witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living, with a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.
[237]
Workers in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards. In terms of consumption, there was more equality, especially as the landed gentry was hard pressed to pay its taxes and had to reduce its level of consumption. As a result of wage rises,
consumer spending
also increased by about 20% during the same period, while economic growth remained at about 3%. In addition, the last food rations were ended in 1954 while hire-purchase controls were relaxed in the same year. As a result of these changes, large numbers of the working classes were able to participate in the consumer market for the first time.
[238]
Entitlement to various fringe benefits was improved. In 1955, 96% of manual labourers were entitled to two weeks' holiday with pay, compared with 61% in 1951. By the end of the 1950s, Britain had become one of the world's most affluent countries, and by the early Sixties, most Britons enjoyed a level of prosperity that had previously been known only to a small minority of the population.
[239]
For the young and unattached there was, for the first time in decades, spare cash for leisure, clothes, and luxuries. In 1959,
Queen
magazine declared that "Britain has launched into an age of unparalleled lavish living." Average wages were high while jobs were plentiful, and people saw their personal prosperity climb even higher. Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan
claimed that "the luxuries of the rich have become the necessities of the poor". As summed up by
R. J. Unstead
,
Opportunities in life, if not equal, were distributed much more fairly than ever before and the weekly wage-earner, in particular, had gained standards of living that would have been almost unbelievable in the thirties.
[240]
As noted by historian Martin Pugh:
Keynesian economic management enabled British workers to enjoy a golden age of full employment which, combined with a more relaxed attitude towards working mothers, led to the spread of the two-income family. Inflation was around 4 per cent, money wages rose from an average of £8 a week in 1951 to £15 a week by 1961, home-ownership spread from 35 per cent in 1939 to 47 per cent by 1966, and the relaxation of credit controls boosted the demand for consumer goods.
[241]
The number one selection for the housewife was a washing machine. Ownership jumped from 18 per cent in 1955 to 29 per cent in 1958, and 60 per cent in 1966.
[242]
By 1963, 82% of all private households had a television, 72% a vacuum cleaner, and 30% a refrigerator. John Burnett notes that ownership had spread down the social scale so that the gap between consumption by professional and manual workers had considerably narrowed. The provision of household amenities steadily improved in the late decades of the century. From 1971 to 1983, households having the sole use of a fixed bath or shower rose from 88% to 97%, and those with an internal WC from 87% to 97%. In addition, the number of households with central heating almost doubled during that same period, from 34% to 64%. By 1983, 94% of all households had a refrigerator, 81% a colour television, 80% a washing machine, 57% a deep freezer, and 28% a tumble-drier.
[243]
Relative decline
[
edit
]
From a European perspective, however, Britain was not keeping pace. Between 1950 and 1970, it was overtaken by most of the countries of the European Common Market in terms of the number of telephones, refrigerators, television sets, cars, and washing machines per 100 of the population.
[244]
Education provision expanded, but not as fast as in neighbouring European countries. By the early 1980s, some 80% to 90% of school leavers in France and West Germany received vocational training, compared with only 40% in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1980s, over 80% of pupils in the United States and West Germany and over 90% in Japan continued in education until the age of eighteen, compared with barely 33% of British pupils.
[245]
In 1987, only 35% of 16- to 18-year-olds were in full-time education or training, compared with 80% in the United States, 77% in Japan, 69% in France, and 49% in Germany.
[246]
Economic growth in Britain, though steady through the 1950s, was not nearly as fast as on the continent. The statistics should be interpreted with care: Britain was far ahead of some other European nations in terms of economic development and urbanisation. Countries like Italy, France and Spain, overwhelmingly agrarian in character at the end of the Second World War, were experiencing a process of rapid industrialisation and urbanisation that Britain had already passed through in the 19th century. This explanation is known as the "early start theory" among economists, and explains why European nations showed markedly stronger levels of absolute growth in industry compared to the UK, a country which was already transitioning into a post-industrial, service-based economy.
[247]
[248]
These countries had large surplus agricultural populations to draw into the cities to work in factories, while the UK as the most heavily urbanised nation in Europe had only a mere 5% of the population employed on the land by 1945 (dropping to 2.7% by 1977). As such, the traditional source of new labour for low-wage factory work, rural labourers, was virtually non-existent in Britain and this constrained growth potential. Immigration from the Commonwealth, and later from Europe, was one policy response to this officially perceived labour shortage.
[248]
There was also a systemic malaise in British industry, which was famously inefficient and opposed to innovations.
Tony Judt
described the prevailing attitude of post-war industrialists: "British factory managers preferred to operate in a cycle of under-investment, limited research and development, low wages and a shrinking pool of clients, rather than risk a fresh start with new products in new markets."
[249]
The overriding emphasis placed on exports by the British government, in its effort to repair the nation's dollar deficit, made things worse, because it encouraged manufacturers to place all investment in expanding output, at the expense of updating machinery, introducing new technologies, improving production methods, etc. This policy was sustainable in the short-term, because in the late 1940s and early 50s world trade boomed and Britain, with its large and relatively undamaged industrial base, was in a uniquely advantageous position to satisfy demand. In 1950, 25% of world exports were British-made, and the total volume of British manufactured goods was double that of France and Germany combined.
[250]
However, by the late 1950s, the economies of West Germany, France, Japan, and Italy, had recovered from wartime infrastructure damage, replacing destroyed stock with state-of-the-art machinery and applying modern production methods in a process called "rejuvenation by defeat".
[247]
Continental governments actively encouraged recovery through direct investment/subsidies in targeted industries, in the case of Italy and France, or more widely through encouraging easy access to credit through national banks, a marked characteristic in France and West Germany. British industrialists saw no such intervention from their own government, which more or less left the private sector to itself.
[251]
British goods were also more expensive abroad because of Sterling's overvaluation, but inferior in quality compared to the products flooding the world market from the United States, Germany and Italy.
Rapid decolonization in the British Empire through the late 1950s and 1960s dealt a further blow to British industry. Britain had enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the consumer markets within the Empire, enforced by the closed Pound Sterling Bloc, but it could not compete once the territories gained independence and were free to negotiate their own trade agreements.
Suez Crisis
[
edit
]
Main article:
Suez Crisis
Although the 1950s were overall a time of prosperity for Britain, the
Suez Crisis
of November 1956 precipitated a financial crisis and a speculative run on Sterling which underlined the fragility of post-war British finances.
[252]
The tripartite invasion of the
Suez Canal Zone
by Britain, France and Israel in late October 1956, following Egypt's
nationalisation
in July of the
Suez Canal Company
(hitherto, a French company, albeit one with a majority share holding owned by the British government), was a disaster for British prestige and the economy. The United States and the United Nations came out firmly against the occupation, which caused a run on sterling as foreign governments withdrew their holdings and converted them into either the US dollar or gold. In the run up to the invasion £214 million was withdrawn by nervous investors and foreign governments. Britain's decision to freeze Egypt's holdings in response to the nationalization inspired panic in other foreign governments who feared their assets might be frozen if they supported the Egyptian cause. With the invasion a further £279 million was withdrawn, leaving a scarce £1.965 billion left in sterling reserves.
[252]
The
Bank of England
sought to prevent devaluation by purchasing the pound on foreign exchange markets, using up its precious dollar reserves in the process. By November dollar reserves had fallen beneath the $2 billion floor which the UK had sought to maintain since the late 1940s.
[253]
Since the Canal was closed to shipping, the UK was reliant on imports of American oil, and devaluing the pound would make oil more expensive and possibly trigger serious inflation.
[253]
Within days of the invasion, the UK had declared a cease-fire and Prime Minister
Anthony Eden
was appealing to the
International Monetary Fund
for a $560 million loan, which was only granted on the condition that the country vacate the Canal Zone. This was agreed to, and Britain received a combined $1.3 billion in loans through the IMF and the American
Export-Import Bank
.
[254]
British withdrawal from the Canal Zone was completed by 22 December, and the pound returned to its pre-crisis parity with the dollar by January 1957, but not without very nearly losing its value as an international reserve currency.

Deindustrialisation
[
edit
]
Further information:
Social history of the United Kingdom (1945-present) § Deindustrialisation
The
United Kingdom
has experienced considerable deindustrialisation, especially in both heavy industry (such as mining and steel) and light manufacturing. New jobs have appeared with either low wages, or with high skill requirements that the laid-off workers lack. Meanwhile, the political reverberations have been growing.
[255]
[256]
Jim Tomlinson agrees that deindustrialisation is a major phenomenon but denies that it represents a decline or failure.
[257]
The UK's share of global manufacturing output had risen from 9.5% in 1830, to 22.9% in the 1870s. It fell to 13.6% by 1913, 10.7% by 1938, and 4.9% by 1973.
[258]
Overseas competition, trade unionism, the welfare state, loss of the
British Empire
, and lack of innovation have all been put forward as explanations for the industrial decline.
[259]
It reached a crisis point in the 1970s, with a worldwide energy crisis, high inflation, and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia. Coal mining quickly
collapsed
and practically disappeared by the 21st century.
[260]
Railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the car-making industry suffered. The government decided in 1964 that underdeveloped or industrially obsolete areas with high unemployment would benefit from economic subsidy, and at least three aluminum smelters enjoyed subsidy "totaling some $144‐million and representing a 40 per cent investment grant for plant and machinery. The two largest smelters were fostered by the decision to authorize cheap bulk sales of electric power based on anticipated breakthroughs in
nuclear power
costs. High power costs in Britain previously militated against the electrolytic aluminum industry, which is an enormous power user... Another purpose of encouraging the development of domestic primary aluminum industry was to reduce imports. Previously, the only primary production in Britain was at
British Aluminium
's
two small Scottish smelters
, which had a total output of 39,000 tons" in 1970.
[261]
Popular responses varied a great deal;
[262]
Tim Strangleman
et al.
found a range of responses from the affected workers: for example, some invoked a glorious industrial past to cope with their new-found personal economic insecurity, while others looked to the European Union for help.
[263]
It has been argued that these reverberations contributed towards the popular vote in favour of
Brexit
in 2016.
[264]
Economists developed two alternative interpretations to explain de-industrialization in Britain. The first was developed by Oxford economists Robert Bacon and Walter Eltis. They argue that the public sector expansion deprived the private sector of sufficient labour and capital. In a word, the government "crowded out" the private sector. A variation of this theory emphasizes the increases in taxation cut the funds needed for wages and profits. Union demands for higher wage rates resulted in lower profitability in the private sector, and a fall in investment. However, many economists counter that public expenditures have lowered unemployment levels, not increased them.
[265]
[266]
[267]
The second explanation is the New Cambridge model associated with
Wynne Godley
and Francis Cripps.
[268]
It stresses the long-term decline and competitiveness of British industry. During the 1970s especially, the manufacturing sector steadily lost its share of both home and international markets. The historic substantial surplus of exports over Imports slipped into an even balance. That balance is maintained by North Sea oil primarily, and to a lesser extent from some efficiency improvement in agriculture and service sectors. The New Cambridge model posits several different causes for the decline in competitiveness. Down to the 1970s, the model stresses bad delivery times, poor design of products, and general low-quality. The implication is that although research levels are high in Britain, industry has been laggard in implementing innovation. The model after 1979 points to the appreciation of sterling against other currencies, so that British products are more expensive. In terms of policy, the New Cambridge model recommends general import controls, or else unemployment will continue to mount.
[269]
The model indicates that deindustrialisation is a serious problem which threatens the nation's ability to maintain balance of payments equilibrium in the long run. The situation after North Sea oil runs out appears troublesome. De-industrialisation imposes that serious social consequences. Workers skilled in the manufacturing sector are no longer needed, and are shuffled off to lower paying, less technologically valuable jobs. Computerisation and globalisation are compounding that problem.
[270]
Nicholas Crafts attributes the relatively poor productivity growth of the British economy during the postwar period to a mixture of failure to invest in equipment and skills, poor management, insufficient competition, dysfunctional management-labour relations and poor economic policy.
[271]
Deindustrialisation meant the closure of many enterprises in mining, heavy industry and manufacturing, with the resulting loss of high paid working-class jobs.
[272]
A certain amount of turnover had always taken place, with older businesses shutting down and new ones opening up. However, the post-1973 scene was different, with a worldwide energy crisis, and an influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia. Coal mining slowly collapsed, and finally disappeared in the 21st century. The railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the automobile industry practically disappeared, apart from some luxury production. There was a range of popular response.
[273]
By the 21st century, grievances accumulated enough to have a political impact.

1976 sterling crisis
While industry performance had remained strong in nearly 20 years following the end of the war, and extensive house building and construction of new commercial developments and public buildings also kept unemployment low throughout this time. As negative factors coalesced during the 1960s, the slogan used by Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan
"(most of) our people have never had it so good" seemed increasingly hollow. The Conservative Government presided over a 'stop-go' economy as it tried to prevent inflation spiralling out of control without snuffing out economic growth. Growth continued to be disappointing, at about only half the rate Germany or France achieved in the same period.
In comparing economic prosperity (using gross national product per person), there was a common perception of continued relative economic decline; Britain slipped from seventh place in the world ranks of income per capita in 1950, to 12th in 1965, and to 20th in 1975. Labour politician
Richard Crossman
, after visiting prosperous Canada, returned to England with a "sense of restriction, yes, even of decline, the old country always teetering on the edge of a crisis, trying to keep up appearances, with no confident vision of the future."
[247]
Economists provided four overlapping explanations. The "early start" theory said that Britain's rivals were doing so well relatively because they were still moving large numbers of farm workers into more lucrative employment, structural change achieved in the UK in the 19th century. A second theory emphasised the "rejuvenation by defeat", whereby Germans and Japanese managers and politicians had been forced to reequip, rethink and restructure their economies. The third approach emphasised the drag of "Imperial distractions", whereby Britain's responsibilities to its extensive, though rapidly declining empire handicapped the domestic economy, especially through defence spending, and economic aid. Finally, the theory of "institutional failure" stressed the negative roles of discontinuity, unpredictability, and class envy. The last theory blamed public schools, and universities perpetuating an elitist anti-industrial attitude while trade unions were regarded as traditionalist and conservative.
[275]
An additional factor, perhaps a feature of the social traditionalism, was the alleged disappointing performance of British management.

Labour responds
[
edit
]
The result was a major political crisis, and a
Winter of Discontent
in the winter of 1978-1979, during which there were widespread strikes by public sector unions that seriously inconvenienced and angered the public.
[276]
[277]
Historians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarised the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:
If Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callaghan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular
modus vivendi
with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that
Mrs. Thatcher
resoundingly defeated it in 1979.
[278]
The
Labour Party
under
Harold Wilson
from 1964 to 1970 was unable to provide a solution either, and eventually devalued the pound from US$2.80 to US$2.40 took effect on 18 November 1967. Economist
Nicholas Crafts
attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor
industrial relations
; and insufficient
vocational training
. He writes that this was a period of
government failure
caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism, and a failure to confront interest groups.
[7]
Both political parties had come to the conclusion that Britain needed to enter the
European Economic Community
(EEC) in order to revive its economy. This decision came after establishing a
European Free Trade Association
(EFTA) with other, non-EEC countries since this provided little economic stimulus to Britain's economy. Levels of trade with the Commonwealth halved in the period 1945-1965 to around 25% while trade with the EEC had doubled during the same period.
Charles de Gaulle
vetoed a British attempt at membership in 1963 and again in 1967.
The
general election in June 1970
saw the Conservatives, now led by
Edward Heath
, achieve a surprise return to government after the opinion polls had suggested a third successive Labour victory. Unemployment was still low by this stage, standing at 3% nationally. It was Heath who took the country into the EEC, in 1973.
[279]
However, with the continuing relative decline of Britain's economy during the 1960s, management-labour relations deteriorated towards the end of the Wilson government and this worker discontent led to a dramatic breakdown of the industrial environment under the
Conservative Government of Edward Heath
(1970-1974). In the early 1970s, the British economy suffered even more as strike action by trade unions, especially successful action by the miners' union, plus the effects of the
1973 oil crisis
, led to a
three-day week
in 1973-74. However, despite a brief period of calm negotiated by the recently re-elected Labour Government of 1974 known as the
Social Contract
, a breakdown with the unions occurred again in 1978, leading to the
Winter of Discontent
, and eventually leading to the end of the Labour Government, then being led by
James Callaghan
, who had succeeded Wilson in 1976.
Unemployment had also risen during this difficult period for the British economy; unemployment reached 1.5 million in 1978 - nearly triple the figure of a decade earlier, with the national rate exceeding 5% for the first time in the postwar era. It had not fallen below 1 million since 1975, and has remained above this level ever since, rarely dropping below 1.5 million.
[280]
Also in the 1970s, oil was found in the
North Sea
, off the coast of Scotland, although its contribution to the UK economy was minimised by the need to pay for rising national debt and for welfare payments to the growing number of unemployed people.

in 1979 marked the end of the

privatisation
and
deregulation
,
reform of industrial relations, and tax changes.
Competition policy
was emphasised instead of
industrial policy
; consequent
deindustrialisation
and
structural unemployment
was more or less accepted.
[7]
Thatcher's battles with the unions culminated in the
Miners' Strike
of 1984.
The Government applied
monetarist
policies to reduce inflation, and reduced public spending. Deflationary measures were implemented against the backdrop of the
recession of 1980/81
. Inflation was at its worst at over 20% in 1980, but by 1982-83 it had subsided to less than 10% and continued to subside until stabilizing at around 4% in the autumn of 1987.
[281]
With the recession of 1980/81, unemployment passed 2 million in the autumn of 1980, 2.5 million the following spring. By January 1982, unemployment had reached 3 million for the first time since the early 1930s, though this time the figure accounted for a lesser percentage of the workforce than the early 1930s figures, now standing at around 12.5% rather than in excess of 20%. In areas hit particularly hard by the loss of industry, unemployment was much higher, coming close to 20% in
Northern Ireland
and exceeding 15% in many parts of
Wales
,
Scotland
and northern England.
[282]
The peak of unemployment actually came some two years after the recession ended and growth had been re-established, when in April 1984 unemployment stood at just under 3.3 million.
[283]
The development of a new financial centre at Canary Wharf was initiated by the Thatcher government to revitalize London's disused docklands area.
According to
Eric Hobsbawm
, Thatcher oversaw an "industrial holocaust", which saw Britain's industrial capacity decrease by fully one quarter during the years 1980-1984.
[284]
Major state-controlled firms were privatised, including
British Aerospace
(1981),
British Telecom
(1984),
British Leyland
(1984),
Rolls-Royce
(1987), and
British Steel Corporation
(1988). The electricity, gas and English water industries were split up and sold off.
Exchange controls
, in operation since the war, were abolished in 1979. This led to more volatile exchange rates, with the pound reaching a low of $1.054 on 25 February 1985 after which it recovered to almost $2 in February 1991. British net assets abroad rose approximately ninefold from £12 billion at the end of 1979 to nearly £110 billion at the end of 1986, a record post-war level and second only to Japan.
[285]
Privatisation of nationalised industries increased share ownership in Britain: the proportion of the adult population owning shares went up from 7% in 1979 to 25% in 1989.
[286]
The
Single European Act
(SEA), signed by Margaret Thatcher, allowed for the free movement of goods within the European Union area. The ostensible benefit of this was to give the spur of competition to the British economy, and increase its ultimate efficiency.
[

]
The
Financial Services Act 1986
led to a
deregulation
later dubbed as
Big Bang
.
The early 1980s recession saw unemployment rise above three million, but the subsequent recovery, which saw annual growth of over 4% in the late 1980s, led to contemporary claims of a British 'economic miracle'.
[287]
There is significant controversy as to whether Thatcherism was the reason for the boom in Britain in the 1980s;
North Sea oil
has been identified as a contributing factor in the increases in economic growth in the mid and late 1980s. However, many of the economic policies put in place by the Thatcher governments have been kept since, and even the Labour Party which had once been so opposed to the policies had by the late 1990s, on its return to government after nearly 20 years in opposition, dropped all opposition to them.
Indeed, the Labour Party of the 1980s had taken a shift to the left after the election of
Michael Foot
as leader in 1980, leading to a split in the party to form the centrist
Social Democratic Party
, which formed an
alliance
with the
Liberals
and contested two general elections, with disappointing results, before merging in 1988 to form the
Liberal Democrats
. The Conservatives were re-elected in 1983 and again in 1987, with a majority of more than 100 seats both times.
By the end of 1986, Britain was in the first stages of an economic boom, which saw unemployment fall below 3 million and reach a 10-year low of 1.6 million by December 1989. However, the rate of economic growth slowed down in 1989, with inflation approaching 10% and fears of an imminent recession being rife in the national media. Interest rates were increased by the government in an attempt to control inflation.
[288]
1990-1997: the Major years
[
edit
]
Main article:
Premiership of John Major
In November 1990, Margaret Thatcher stood down from the office of Prime Minister after losing first the confidence and then the support in Parliament of the Conservative Party's MPs, which she needed in order to continue.
John Major
was elected her successor. The government's popularity was also falling following the introduction of poll tax earlier that year, while unemployment was also starting to increase again as another recession loomed. Opinion polls were suggesting that the next general election could be won by Labour, led by
Neil Kinnock
since the resignation of Michael Foot in 1983.
Despite several major economies showing quarterly detraction during 1989, the British economy continued to grow well into 1990, with the first quarterly detraction taking place in the third quarter of the year, by which time unemployment was starting to creep upwards again after four years of falling. The beginning of another recession was confirmed in January 1991. Interest rates had been increased between 1988 and 1990 to control inflation, which topped 10% in 1990 but was below 3% by the end of 1992.
Economic growth was not re-established until early 1993, but the Conservative government which had been in power continuously since 1979 managed to achieve re-election in April 1992, fending off a strong challenge from Neil Kinnock and Labour, although with a significantly reduced majority.
[289]
The
early 1990s recession
was officially the longest in Britain since the Great Depression some 60 years earlier, though the fall in output was not as sharp as that of the downturn of the Great Depression or even that of the early 1980s recession. It had started during 1990 and the end of the recession was not officially declared until April 1993, by which time nearly 3 million people were unemployed.
[290]
The British pound was tied to EU exchange rates, using the
Deutsche Mark
as a basis, as part of the
Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM); however, this resulted in disaster for Britain. The restrictions imposed by the ERM put pressure on the pound, leading to a run on the currency.
Black Wednesday
in September 1992 ended British membership of the ERM. It also damaged the credibility of the Conservative's reputation for economic competence, and contributed to the end of the 18 years of consecutive Conservative government in 1997. The party had long been divided over European issues and many of these rifts within the party had still not been mended by 1997.
Despite the downfall of the Conservative government, it had seen a strong economic recovery in which unemployment had fallen by more than 1 million since the end of 1992 to 1.7 million by the time of their election defeat just over four years later. Inflation also remained low, with the ERM exit in 1992 being followed by a gradual decrease in interest rates during the years that followed.

1997-2001: New Labour
[

See also:
Blairism
and
Premiership of Tony Blair
From May 1997,
Tony Blair
's newly elected Labour government stuck with the Conservatives' spending plans. The
Chancellor
,
Gordon Brown
, gained a reputation by some as the "prudent Chancellor" and helped to inspire renewed confidence in Labour's ability to manage the economy following the economic failures of earlier Labour governments. One of the first acts that the new Labour government embarked on was to give the power to set interest rates to the
Bank of England
, effectively ending the use of interest rates as a political tool. Control of the banks was given to the Financial Services Agency.
Labour introduced the
minimum wage
, which has been raised every year since its introduction in April 1999. The Blair government also introduced a number of strategies to cut unemployment, including an expansion of the public sector. Unemployment was constantly below 1.5 million during the first half of the 2000s - a level not seen since the late 1970s, although the government never succeeded in getting unemployment back into the six figure tallies which were seen for most of the 30 years after the end of World War II.
The level of trade union membership fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strong—e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docks—was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.
[292]
In 2011, there were 6,135,000 members in TUC-affiliated unions, down from a peak of 12,174,000 in 1980. Trade union density was 14.1% in the private sector and 56.5% in the public sector.

Further information:
Economy of the United Kingdom
In the Labour Party's second term in office, beginning in 2001, when it achieved another landslide victory, the party increased taxes and borrowing. The government wanted the money to increase spending on public services, notably the
National Health Service
, which they claimed was suffering from chronic under-funding. The economy shifted from manufacturing, which had been declining since the 1960s and grew on the back of the services and finance sectors, while the public sector continued to expand. The country was also at war with first
Afghanistan
, invading in 2001 and then
Iraq
, in 2003 - which proved controversial with the British public. Spending on both reached several billion pounds a year and the government's popularity began to slide, although it did manage to win a third general election under Blair in 2005 with a reduced majority. Blair stepped down two years later after a decade as prime minister to be succeeded by the former Chancellor
Gordon Brown
, the change of leader coming at a time when Labour was starting to lag behind the Conservatives (led by
David Cameron
) in the opinion polls.
By this stage, unemployment had increased slightly to 1.6 million although the economy continued to grow, the UK was continuing to lose large numbers of manufacturing jobs due to companies encountering financial problems or switching production overseas to save labour costs. This was particularly evident in the car industry, with
General Motors
(
Vauxhall
) and Ford having significantly cut back on UK operations, while
Peugeot
(the French carmaker who had bought the former
Rootes Group
and
Chrysler Europe
operations in the late 1970s) had completely withdrawn from Britain. These closures resulted in thousands of job losses, although the biggest single blow to the car industry came in 2005 when
MG Rover
went into liquidation; more than 6,000 jobs were lost at the carmaker alone and some 20,000 more were lost in associated supply industries and dealerships, not to mention the business failures and job cuts which befell businesses that had relied largely on trade from the carmaker's employees. This was the largest collapse of any European carmaker in modern times.
Growth rates were consistently between 1.6% and 3% from 2000 to early 2008. Inflation though relativity steady at around 2%, did rise in the approach to the financial crash. The Bank of England's control of interest rates was a major factor in the stability of the British economy over that period.

The
pound
continued to fluctuate, however, reaching a low against the dollar in 2001 (to a rate of $1.37 per £1), but rising again to a rate of approximately $2 per £1 in 2007. Against the Euro, the pound was steady at a rate of approximately €1.45 per £1. Since then, the effects of the
Credit crunch
have led to a slowdown of the economy. At the start of November 2008, for example, the pound was worth around €1.26; by the end of the year, it had almost approached parity, dropping at one point below €1.02 and ending the year at €1.04.

Great Recession
The UK entered a recession in Q2 of 2008, according to the UK
Office for National Statistics
(ONS) and exited it in Q4 of 2009. The revised ONS figures of November 2009 showed that the UK had suffered six consecutive quarters of contraction.
[294]
[295]
On 23 January 2009, Government figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK was officially in
recession
for the first time since 1991.
[296]
It entered a recession in the final quarter of 2008, accompanied by unemployment rising from 5.2% in May 2008 to 7.6% in May 2009. The unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds rose from 11.9% to 17.3%.
[297]
Although initially Britain lagged behind other major economies including Germany, France, Japan, and the US which all returned to growth in the second quarter of 2009, the country eventually returned to growth in the last quarter of 2009. On 26 January 2010, it was confirmed that the UK had left its recession, the last major economy in the world to do so.
[298]
In the 3 months to February 2010 the UK economy grew yet again by 0.4%.
[299]
In Q2 of 2010 the economy grew by 1.2% the fastest rate of growth in 9 years. In Q3 of 2010 figures released showed the UK economy grew by 0.8%; this was the fastest Q3 growth in 10 years.
On 5 March 2009, the Bank of England announced that they would pump £200 billion of new capital into the economy through a process known as
quantitative easing
. This is the first time in the United Kingdom's history that this measure has been used, although the Bank's Governor
Mervyn King
suggested it was not an experiment.
[300]
The process saw the BoE creating new money for itself, which it used to purchase assets such as government bonds, bank loans, and mortgages.
[301]
Despite the misconception that quantitative easing involves printing money, instead the money was created electronically and thus did not actually enter the cash circulation system.
[302]
The initial amount created through this method was £75 billion, although former
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Alistair Darling
had given permission for up to £150 billion to be created if necessary.
[303]
It is thought the process is likely to occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term.
[300]
The BoE has stated that the decision has been taken to prevent the rate of inflation falling below the two per cent target rate.
[301]
Mervyn King, the Governor of the BoE, also suggested there were no other monetary options left as interest rates had already been cut to their lowest level ever of 0.5% and it was unlikely they would be cut further.
[303]
As of the end of November 2009, the economy had shrunk by 4.9%, making the 2008-2009 recession the longest since records began.
[299]
In December 2009, the Office for National Statistics revised figures for the third quarter of 2009 showed that the economy shrank by 0.2%, compared to a 0.6% fall the previous quarter.
[294]
[
]
It has been suggested that the UK initially lagged behind its European neighbours because the UK entered the 2008 recession later. However, German GDP fell 4.7% year on year compared to the UK's 5.1%, and Germany has now posted a second quarterly gain in GDP.
[304]
Commentators suggested that the UK suffered a slightly longer recession than other large European countries as a result of government policy dating back to the policies of the
Thatcher government
of 1979, in which UK governments have moved away from supporting manufacturing and focused on the financial sector.
[305]
[306]
[307]
The OECD predicts that the UK will grow 1.6% in 2010. The unemployment rate recorded by the
Labour Force Survey
fell in the fourth quarter of 2009,
[308]
the first of the big three economies in the EU to do so. GDP decreased by a (second revision) figure of 0.2% in the third quarter of 2009, after a decrease of 0.6% in the second quarter, according to the
Office for National Statistics
(ONS).
[294]
There was a 2.4% decline in the first quarter of 2009. By October 2009 the economy had contracted 5.9% from its peak before the recession began.
[309]
In October 2007, the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) had forecast British GDP to grow by 3.1% in 2007 and 2.3% in 2008.
[310]
However, GDP growth slowed to a fall of 0.1% in the April-June (second) quarter of 2008 (revised down from zero).
[311]
In September 2008, the OECD forecast contraction for at least two quarters for the UK economy, possibly severe, placing its predicted performance last in the G7 of leading economies.
[312]
Six quarters later the UK economy was still contracting, placing a question mark over OECD forecasting methods.
It has been argued that heavy government borrowing over the past cycle has led to a severe structural deficit, reminiscent of
previous crises
, which will inevitably exacerbate the situation and place the UK economy in an unfavourable position compared to its
OECD
partners as attempts are made to stimulate recovery, other OECD nations having allowed greater room for manoeuvre thanks to contrasting policies of relatively tighter fiscal control prior to the global downturn.
[313]
In May 2009 the
European Commission
(EC) stated: "The UK economy is now clearly experiencing one of its worst recessions in recent history." The EC expected GDP to decline 3.8% in 2009 and projected that growth will remain negative for the first three quarters of 2009. It predicted two quarters of "virtual stagnation" in late 2009 and early 2010, followed by a gradual return to "slight positive growth by late 2010".
[314]
The
FTSE 100
and
FTSE 250
rose to their highest levels in a year on 9 September 2009 with the FTSE 100 breaking through 5,000 and the FTSE 250 breaking through 9,000. On 8 September the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research
believed that the economy had grown by 0.2% in the three months to August, but was proved wrong. In its eyes the UK recession was officially over, although it did warn that "normal economic conditions" had not returned. On the same day, figures also showed UK manufacturing output rising at its fastest rate in 18 months in July.
[315]
On 15 September 2009 the
European Union
incorrectly predicted the UK economy to grow by 0.2% between July and September, on the same day the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King said the UK GDP was now growing.
[316]
At the same time unemployment fell in Wales.
[317]
Many commentators in the UK were certain that the UK would leave recession officially in Q3, believing that all the signs showed that growth was extremely likely, although in fact government spending had been insufficient to rescue the economy from recession at that point. Figures in fact showed no growth in retail sales in September 2009, and a 2.5% decline in industrial output in August.
[309]
The revised UK figures confirmed that the economy shrank in Q3 of 2009 by 0.2%, although government spending on cash for the car scrappage scheme helped. The car scrappage scheme enabled owners of cars at least 10 years old to buy a new car at a reduced price in return for having their old car scrapped, and proved very popular with motorists.
Yet this temporary lapse was followed by a solid 0.4% growth in the Q4.
UK manufacturers' body, the EEF, appealed for more cash from the government: "Without an extension of support for business investment in the pre-Budget statement next month, it will be difficult to see where the momentum for growth will come from."
[318]
The downturn in the economy during 2008 and 2009 saw the popularity of the Labour government slump, and opinion polls all showed the Conservatives in the lead during this time, although by early 2010 the gap between the parties was narrow enough to suggest that the imminent general election would result in a
hung parliament
- as happened in May 2010. The Conservatives had the largest number of seats in the
election
, 20 short of a majority, and formed a government in coalition with the
Liberal Democrats
. The new government was faced with having to make deep public spending cuts over the following years in order to tackle the high level of national debt which had mounted up during Labour's response to the recession, which meant that unemployment remained high and the economy struggled to re-establish growth, although a marked improvement finally occurred in 2013 when economic growth and falling unemployment were sustained.
Moody's
maintained the UK's
AAA credit rating
in September 2010, forecasting stable finances largely driven by governmental action. It also reported that while the economy is flexible to grow in the future household debt repayments, a poor export market and the economy's large exposure to the finance sector were factors likely to sap growth.
[319]
Subsequent to that, the economy contracted in 5 of the next 7 quarters, thus ensuring zero net growth from the end of the recession at the end of 2009, through to the middle of 2012. In 2010, the economy picked up and growing steadily however in the summer the
European debt crisis
centred on Greece led to a second slow down in all European countries. The
euro-zone
entered a double dip recession that lasted from Q1 2011 until Q2 2013, and while the UK had no double dip recession it did however experience stagnant growth.
[320]
While the first half of 2012 saw inflationary pressures subside and business confidence increase, a number of fundamental weaknesses remain, most notably a decline in the productivity of British business.
[321]
From Q2 2013, the UK's economy continued to grow for five consecutive quarters, the longest since Q1 of 2008,
[322]
showing growth beating most developed economies helped by the rebound in the housing market and strong growth in both manufacturing and services industries. The IMF increased UK growth forecasts for 2014 from 1.9% to 2.4% in January 2014.
[323]
Subsequently, inflation dropped to a low of 1.6% in Q1 2014,
[324]
unemployment dropped to 6.8% (the lowest level since 2009)
[325]
with impressive growth in employment leading to an all-time high of 30.4 million.
[326]
The UK government posted a £107.6 billion national deficit for the fiscal year ending March 2014, meeting the target of £107.7 billion set a month previously.
[327]
This was especially impressive since many countries in the EU, more specifically in the
Euro
, were stagnating such as France and Italy.
[328]
However, it has been argued that the economic recovery was not reaching the majority of the people in the country, with wage growth not keeping up with inflation. In 2014 this metric improved with wage growth outpacing inflation for the first time after six years.

2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum

Main article:
2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum
When the Conservative Party won a majority of seats in the House of Commons at the
2015 general election
, its leader Prime Minister
David Cameron
reiterated his party's
manifesto
commitment to hold an in-out referendum on UK membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but only after "negotiating a new settlement for Britain in the EU".
[330]
On 23 June 2016, a
referendum
, commonly referred to as the
EU referendum
or the
Brexit referendum
, took place in the United Kingdom (UK) and
Gibraltar
to ask the electorate whether the country should remain a member of, or leave, the
European Union
(EU). It was organised and facilitated through the
European Union Referendum Act 2015
and the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000
. The referendum resulted in 51.9% of the votes cast being in favour of leaving the EU. The referendum was legally non-binding due to the ancient principle of
parliamentary sovereignty
and also the enabling legislation only specified that a referendum should be held; however, the government of the time promised to implement the result.

The withdrawal officially took place at 23:00

on 31 January 2020 (00:00 1 February 2020
CET
).
[a]
The UK is the only
sovereign country
to have left the EU. The UK had been a member state of the EU or its predecessor, the
European Communities
(EC), since 1 January 1973.  This began a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT), during which the UK and EU negotiated their future relationship.
[332]
During the transition, the UK remained subject to
EU law
and remained part of the
European Union Customs Union
and the
European Single Market
. However, it was no longer part of the EU's political bodies or institutions.
[333]
[334]
The
EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
(TCA) is a
free trade agreement
signed on 30 December 2020, between the
European Union
(EU), the
European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom), and the
United Kingdom
(UK). It
provisionally applied
[335]
[336]
from 1 January 2021, when the
Brexit transition period
ended,
[337]
before formally entering into force on 1 May 2021, after the ratification processes on both sides were completed: the
UK Parliament
ratified on 30 December 2020;
[338]
the
European Parliament
and the
Council of the European Union
ratified in late April 2021.
On the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, the border in Ireland became the only land border between the UK and EU.
EU single market
and
UK internal market
provisions require certain customs checks and trade controls at their external borders. The
Northern Ireland Protocol
is intended to protect the EU single market, while avoiding imposition of a '
hard border
' that might incite a recurrence of conflict and destabilise the relative peace that has held since the end of "
the Troubles
". Under the Protocol as originally agreed, Northern Ireland is formally outside the EU single market, but
EU free movement of goods
rules and
EU Customs Union
rules still apply; this ensures there are no
customs
checks or controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the island. Goods from Northern Ireland may be moved without restriction to Great Britain but not conversely. Thus, in place of a Republic of Ireland/Northern Ireland land border, the protocol has created a
de facto
customs
border in the Irish Sea
, separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain,
[339]
[340]
to the disquiet of prominent
Unionists
.
Historiography of business in the United Kingdom
[
edit

George Unwin
Business history in Britain emerged in the 1950s following the publication of a series of influential company histories and the establishment of the journal
Business History
[341]
in 1958 at the University of Liverpool. The most influential of these early company histories was
Charles Wilson
's
History of Unilever
, the first volume of which was published in 1954. Other examples include
D. C. Coleman
's work on Courtaulds and artificial fibres, B. W. E. Alford on Wills and the tobacco industry, and
T. C. (Theo) Barker
on Pilkington's and glass manufacture.
[342]
[343]
These early studies were conducted primarily by economic historians interested in the role of leading firms in the development of the wider industry, and therefore went beyond mere corporate histories. Although some work examined the successful industries of the industrial revolution and the role of the key entrepreneurs, in the 1960s scholarly debate in British business history became increasingly focused on economic decline. For economic historians, the loss of British competitive advantage after 1870 could at least in part be explained by entrepreneurial failure, prompting further business history research into individual industry and corporate cases. However, by 1970 this interpretation of 'entrepreneurial failure' had been challenged by
cliometricians
, notably by
Deirdre McCloskey
, who quantitatively assessed the productivity path of the British economy in a more favourable light. More traditional analysis presented by Peter Payne in
British Entrepreneurship in the Nineteenth Century
[344]
presented a similar, though more deliberately nuanced, refutation of the thesis of "entrepreneurial failure"
[345]
One debate concerns the performance of firms in the Lancashire cotton textile industry. Often seen as the "leading sector" that propelled "
economic take-off
" of industrialisation, by 1890 its firms appeared relatively slow to invest in and adopt recent technological developments and demonstrated low levels of relative labour productivity by 1900.
William Lazonick
for example argued that cotton textile entrepreneurs in Lancashire, like their American cotton-textile producing counterparts, failed to develop the larger integrated plants found in other sectors of the American economy; a general conclusion proposed by Chandler in a number of comparative case studies.
[346]
[347]
Paradoxically, J. & P. Coats, a Scottish cotton manufacturing firm headquartered in
Paisley, Renfrewshire
, not only achieved the industry's highest levels of productivity, in the world, let alone the United Kingdom, but the company also owned, amongst its impressive portfolio of subsidiaries, what was probably the best performing cotton manufacturing firm in the United States of America.
[
specify
]
While Lancashire may have failed, J. & P. Coats, the world's largest manufacturing company by equity market value in 1900, did not.
With the economic performance of British businessmen before 1914 now viewed in a better informed and more balanced way, the critics turned to sociology to emphasise their position in the class structure, especially their supposed subordinate relationship to the aristocracy, and their desire to use their wealth to purchase landed estates, and acquire hereditary titles.
[348]
[349]
[350]
British business history began to widen its scope in the 1980s, with innovative research conducted at the
London School of Economics
's Business History Unit, led first by
Leslie Hannah
, then by Terry Gourvish; here David Jeremy edited the multi-volume.
[351]
A similar collection of biographies was published by scholars associated with the Centre for Business History in
Glasgow
, the
Dictionary of Scottish Business Biography
.
[352]
Other research centres followed, including Reading, reflecting an increasing involvement in the discipline by Business and Management School academics.
The journal
Business History
reflected the widening ambition of the discipline as editors, first,
Geoffrey Jones
(Harvard Business School), Charles Harvey (University of Newcastle Business School), and more latterly, John Wilson (University of Newcastle Business School) and Steven Toms (Leeds University Business School) promoted management strategy themes such as networks, family capitalism, corporate governance, human resource management, marketing and brands, and multi-national organisations in their international as well as merely British context. These new themes have allowed business historians to challenge and adapt the earlier conclusions of
Alfred D. Chandler Jr.
and others about British businessmen and the performance of the British economy.

Purifoy's problems off the field may have contributed to a slip from a late draft pick to an undrafted free agent.
[8]
On May 12, 2014, it was announced that the
Indianapolis Colts
agreed to terms with Purifoy.
[9]
Purifoy went into the preseason with a competition with fellow cornerback
Marcus Burley
. Both performed well and cutting either would be difficult, so the Colts traded Burley to the
Seattle Seahawks
for a sixth round draft pick.
[10]
The Colts kept Purifoy and was on their initial 53-man roster.

"
That Still Small Voice
" is the fifth episode of the American
fairy tale
/
drama
television series
Once Upon a Time
. The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the "real world" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Henry (
Jared S. Gilmore
) becomes upset when told by Archie (
Raphael Sbarge
) that his fairy tale theories are delusions; Henry places himself in danger when he investigates a mysterious sinkhole, forcing a regretful Archie to save him. Meanwhile, the backstory of
Jiminy Cricket
(Sbarge) is revealed - he yearns to leave his
con artist
parents and become a good person, but accidentally hurts an innocent couple along the way.
It was the first
Once Upon a Time
episode to be written by consulting producer
Jane Espenson
, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was "thrilled" to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that."
[1]
In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series
Lost
and the Disney film
One Hundred and One Dalmatians
.
"That Still Small Voice" first aired in the United States on November 27, 2011, with the network
ABC
. An estimated 10.7 million viewers watched the episode, helping it finish in third place for its timeslot. "That Still Small Voice" finished in fourteenth place for the week among the major networks. Since then, it has garnered generally positive critical reviews. Many praised Espenson's screenwriting, as well as Jiminy's characterization and the performances of Sbarge and
Robert Carlyle
.
Plot

Opening sequence

A straw spinning wheel is shown in the forest.
In the characters' past
[
edit
]
In the Enchanted Forest, a young pickpocket named Jiminy desires the chance to be a good person, but is forced by his father (
Harry Groener
) and mother (
Carolyn Hennesy
) to participate in their cons. After he finishes collecting some stolen goods, Jiminy tells them that he desires to leave the family business. Unfortunately, as years go by, the now-adult Jiminy (
Raphael Sbarge
) is still aiding his parents, who come up with excuses to keep him from leaving. He runs into a young boy who tells him to follow his conscience. One night, Jiminy pays a visit to see Rumpelstiltskin (
Robert Carlyle
) and is given a tonic that will set him free from his parents and is told to either have them drink it or throw it over them.
Later that evening, Jiminy and his parents convince a couple to give up some goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that he has a chance to help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.
In Storybrooke
[
edit
]
In the present day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) continues to evaluate Henry (
Jared S. Gilmore
), who is still trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (
Jamie Dornan
) officially makes
Emma Swan
(
Jennifer Morrison
) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (
Lana Parrilla
) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.
The next day, Archie follows through on Regina's warning by convincing Henry that the fairy tale stories are not real, upsetting Henry. This prompts Emma to pay a visit to Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (
Tony Amendola
), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place.
Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why he refuses to believe that he is Jiminy Cricket. Archie acknowledges that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it is revealed that it is a small shard of the infamous glass coffin of Snow White's (
Ginnifer Goodwin
).
Concurrent with these events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) continues to visit the amnesiac David (
Joshua Dallas
) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (
Anastasia Griffith
) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember anything that he saw in the pictures, although he claimed otherwise when talking with Kathryn. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital.
Production and cultural references
[
edit

The episode featured Jiminy Cricket (played by
Raphael Sbarge
)
"That Still Small Voice" was the first
Once Upon a Time
episode written by consulting producer
Jane Espenson
.
[2]
She was drawn to join the series because she believed a curse involving fairy tale characters was a "fantastic concept". She explained, "What's the modern take on Jiminy Cricket and Rumpelstiltskin? What would their issues be in the real world? The beauty of the production, the care and the effort and, honestly, the expense that was put into it just made clear that was a project done with a lot of attention and love."
[3]
The episode was directed by
Lost
veteran Paul Edwards.
[4]
"That Still Small Voice", featuring Jiminy Cricket, was assigned to Espenson, and she was "thrilled to get it," as she wanted to explore the character in his own story. She elaborated that Jiminy is
Someone who you might think of as being part of someone else’s story - even in
Pinocchio
, he’s all about someone else’s arc. I like taking that character and reminding us all that everyone is the hero of their own story. I related to him because of that, and also because it was such an identifiable story — the way so many people have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that.
[1]
Actor
Raphael Sbarge
became attracted to join the series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world and the other in a modern setting.
[5]
In an interview with
The Hollywood Reporter
, Sbarge compared
Once Upon a Time
to the television series
Lost
"in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive."
[6]
When Sbarge read the script for "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about "treading into people's imaginations," but ultimately decided that "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell."
[7]
Believing that his character was "sort of a surrogate father figure" to Henry, Sbarge admitted that the script "made me weep because what they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful."
[8]
Referring to his character's storyline as a
hero's journey
, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy - "what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing."
[5]
The episode featured guest stars
Harry Groener
and
Carolyn Hennesy
as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the
third season
of the fantasy television series
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
.
[9]
It is their only appearances in the series.
[10]
[11]
The episode contains several cultural references and allusions. The scenes in which Henry was carrying a couple of Apollo Chocolate Candy Bars in his back pack was also the same brand of candy bars made by the DHARMA Initiative on
Lost
,
[12]
[13]
while Archie's pet Pongo is also the name of one of the dogs in the Disney film
One Hundred and One Dalmatians
.
[9]
The episode's title, "That Still Small Voice", is an apparent allusion, or reference to a
Biblical
passage in the
Books of Kings
: "
but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice
."

Reviews
[
edit
]
The episode was met with generally positive reviews.
Writing for
AOL TV
, Laura Prudom noted that the episode "proved to be an undeniably satisfying hour of television, deepening our understanding of Archie/Jiminy's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David's tragic romance. I don't know about you, but I really could watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show."
[20]
Entertainment Weekly
columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she "ragged on Robert Carlyle initially, his campy Rumpel is quickly becoming one of my favorite parts of this show."
[13]
Tor.com
's Teresa Jusino called Espenson's script "so engaging" because it deviated from the series' typical two-story format and "incorporated a third, separate modern storyline" that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket, in which "each storyline got just enough attention."
[1]
She added that the episode's best parts were its "intimate character moments, particularly the scenes between Archie/Jiminy and the boys in his life," and attributed this to Espenson's strength as a writer. Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge's performance, as he "navigated both Archie and Jiminy’s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth."
[1]
Oliver Sava of
The A.V. Club
graded the episode with a C. He criticized Gilmore's performance in "That Still Small Voice" and earlier episodes, writing that "Gilmore struggles to make a connection with his character, so it always looks like he’s reading lines," which might have a negative effect on the Henry's character development.
[9]
Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote "this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors."
[9]
Conversely,
IGN
's Amy Ratcliffe said she has "never liked Henry as much as I did in this episode," especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket.
[21]
Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the "most touching backstory" of the season up to that point, opining that "the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far."
[21]
She graded "That Still Small Voice" with 8 out of 10, an indication of a "great" episode.

Background
[
edit
]
During an interview with the blog Social Writers, Kano said that "It was really important to me that it really made sense as an album. I didn't want it to be single driven. I really wanted it to have substance in the tracks, really wanted it to the track  [
sic
] to mean something to me, I really wanted to experiment and make the album very exciting". He also described his progression on
Method to the Maadness
, as an MC from his first album
Home Sweet Home
: "I didn’t really know what I was doing on that album (Home Sweet Home). It's about progression with every album, learning from the last and just getting a little bit more educated and more experienced as a performer and as a recording artist, as a writer and a producer and co-producer. So, I feel I've definitely progressed".

Will Dean of

wrote that
Method to the Maadnes
is "a record that deserves at least a modicum of
Rascalesque
success."
[7]
Matt Oliver of

concluded that "While room for improvement remains, less culpable decisions are made compared to the pleased-to conform
London Town
. Kano’s well back on track to reclaiming grime’s all-rounder crown."
[6]
In a review for
BBC Music
, Sam Hesketh stated: "Kano hasn't reached the peaks of his debut album here, but when it works,
Maadness
works very well indeed. He's a talented rapper, and his lyrics are on point for the vast majority of the record; but let's hope he works exclusively to his strengths next time instead of trying to be experimental for the sake of it."
[9]
Anna Trench of
The Telegraph
wrote: "Grime star Kano’s third album is a mixed bag. Half the tracks feature guests, and although on the whole these work well, one wonders how dependant he is on his collaborators. You can still hear his roots in the raw opener 2 Left: Topic of Discussion. As a lyricist he’s impressive, particularly on "Spaceship" and "All + All Together": perceptive, current and sometimes sad, but with just the right amount of swagger and wit."

Adrien de Gerlache
de Gerlache
is a
lunar
impact crater
that is located along the southern limb of the
Moon
, within a crater diameter of
Shackleton
at the
south pole
. From the
Earth
this crater is seen from the edge, and it lies in
perpetual darkness
. Thus little or no detail can be seen of this crater, other than the edge of the
rim
. However, the crater is clearly visible in Earth-based radar images.
[1]
The crater is roughly circular, with some slight wear. No craters of note overlie the rim, although some formations may be attached to the southern and western edges.
The crater was identified by
Jean-Luc Margot
and
Donald B. Campbell
who jointly proposed the name to the
International Astronomical Union
. The name, honoring the Belgian explorer
Adrien de Gerlache
, was adopted by the
IAU
in 2000.
[2]
In April 2023, a smaller crater on the floor of de Gerlache was named Brill by the IAU.

Aspect of history
The
history of local government in England
is one of gradual change and evolution since the
Middle Ages
.
England
has never possessed a formal written
constitution
, with the result that modern administration (and the judicial system) is based on precedent, and is derived from administrative powers granted (usually by
the Crown
) to older systems, such as that of the
shires
.
The concept of
local government in England
spans back into the
history of Anglo-Saxon England
(c. 700-1066), and certain aspects of its modern system are directly derived from this time; particularly the paradigm that towns and the countryside should be administrated separately. In this context, the
feudal system
introduced by the
Normans
, and perhaps lasting 300 years, can be seen as a 'blip', before earlier patterns of administration re-emerged.
The dramatic increase in population, and change in population distribution caused by the
Industrial Revolution
necessitated similarly dramatic reform in local administration in England, which was achieved gradually throughout the 19th century. Much of the 20th century was spent searching for an idealised system of local government. The most sweeping change in that period was the
Local Government Act 1972
, which resulted in a uniform two-tier system of counties and districts being introduced in 1974; however, further waves of reform have led to a more heterogeneous system in use today.
Origins of local government in England
[
edit
]
Much of the basic structure of local government in
England
is derived directly from the
Kingdom of England
(which became part of the
Kingdom of Great Britain
in 1707 then later part of the
United Kingdom
). There are thus aspects of the modern system which are not shared with the other constituent parts of the UK, namely
Scotland
,
Wales
and
Northern Ireland
.
The Kingdom of England was by origin an extension of the
Saxon
Kingdom of Wessex
into the other regions, supplanting amongst others the former kingdoms of
Mercia
,
Northumbria
and
Kingdom of East Anglia
, and unifying the
Anglo-Saxon peoples
of the
British Isles
. Some of the basic elements of modern local government therefore derive from the ancient system of Wessex.
Anglo-Saxon local government (700-1066 AD)
[
edit
]
The
Kingdom of Wessex
, c. 790 AD, was divided into administrative units known as
shires
. Each shire was governed by an
Ealdorman
, a major nobleman of Wessex appointed to the post by the King. The term 'Ealdorman' (meaning 'elder-man') gradually merged with the Scandinavian Eorl/Jarl (designating an important chieftain), to form the modern 'Earl'. However, the Shires were not comparable with later
Earldoms
, and were not held in the Ealdorman's own right; the position was appointive, rather than a hereditary title of nobility.
The shires of Wessex at this time have essentially survived to the present day, as
counties of England
(currently
ceremonial counties
). They included Defnascir (
Devon
), Sumorsaete (
Somerset
), Dornsaete (
Dorset
), Wiltunscir (
Wiltshire
), Hamptunscir (
Hampshire
). When Wessex conquered the petty kingdoms of southern England, namely
Kent
and that of the
South Saxons
, these were simply reconstituted as shires (modern
Kent
and
Sussex
respectively).
As Wessex took over progressively larger areas of Mercia, East Anglia and Northumbria, the new lands were divided into shires, usually named after the principal town in the new shire; hence
Northamptonshire
,
Oxfordshire
,
Derbyshire
and so on. Most of the
historic counties
of England (and modern
Ceremonial counties
) south of the
Mersey
and
Humber
derive directly from this time.
Another important shire official was the shire-reeve; the modern day derivative is a
sheriff
or
high sheriff
. The shire-reeve was responsible for upholding the law, and holding civil and criminal courts in the shire.
[1]
The office of sheriff is still important in some
Anglophone countries
(e.g. the
United States
), but now a ceremonial role in England.
Below the level of the shire, the Anglo-Saxon system was very different from the later systems of local government. The shire was divided into an unlimited number of
hundreds
(or
wapentakes
in the
Danelaw
counties of
Yorkshire
,
Derbyshire
,
Leicestershire
,
Northamptonshire
,
Nottinghamshire
,
Rutland
and
Lincolnshire
). Each hundred consisted of 10 groups of 10 households. A group of 10 households was a
tithing
and each household held one
hide
of land. The hide was an arbitrary unit of land which was deemed able to support one household, and thus could vary in size. The whole hundred system was thus both very flexible and fluid, varying with changes in population etc.
Hundreds were led by a 'hundred-man', and had their own 'hundred' courts. The members of the hundreds (or tithings, etc.) were collectively held responsible for each individual's conduct, thereby decentralising the administration of justice upon the people themselves. Hundreds were used as administrative units for the raising of armies, collection of taxes and so forth.
The Norman conquest (1066-1100)
[
edit
]
England in 1086 showing hundreds, wapentakes and wards
The
conquest of England
by the
Normans
in 1066 brought about many changes in the local administration of the country, but some aspects were retained. One of the biggest changes was the introduction of a severe feudal system by the Normans. Although
Anglo-Saxon
society had also been essentially
feudal
in character, the Norman system was much more rigid, centralised and thorough.
William the Conqueror
claimed ultimate possession of virtually all the land in England and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit. Thenceforth, all land was "held" from the King.
[2]
The country was divided up into fiefs which William distributed amongst his followers. The
fiefs
were generally small and given out piecemeal, to deprive William's vassals of large power-bases.
Since each
fiefdom
was governed more or less independently of each other by the
feudal lords
, the Anglo-Saxon
shire
system became less important. However, the system did continue in use. The shires (referred to by the Normans as 'counties', in analogy to the system in use in
medieval France
) remained the major geographical division of England. North of the
Humber
, the Normans reorganised the shires to form one new large county, that of
Yorkshire
. Immediately after the conquest the rest of northern England does not seem to have been in Norman hands; as the remainder of England came under Norman rule it too was also constituted into new counties (e.g.
Lancashire
,
Northumberland
) In the period immediately after the Norman conquest, hundreds also remained as the basic administrative unit. In the
Domesday Book
, the great Norman work of bureaucracy, the survey is taken shire by shire, and hundred by hundred. At this time, if not before, hundreds must have become more static units of land, since the more fluid nature of the original system would not have been compatible with the rigid feudal system of the Normans. Although hundreds continued to alter in size and number after the
Domesday Book
, they became more permanent administrative divisions, rather than groups of households.
The Early Middle Ages (1100-1300)
[
edit
]
During the Middle Ages local administration remained in the hands of the feudal lords, who governed affairs in their fiefs. The enserfment of the population by the Norman system diminished the importance of hundreds as self-regulating
social units
since law was not imposed from above, and since the population was immobilised. Instead the basic
social unit
became the
parish
,
manor
or
township
.
The counties remained important as the basis for the legal system. The sheriff remained the paramount legal officer in each county, and each county eventually had its own court system for trials (the
quarter sessions
). Although the hundred courts continued in use resolving local disputes, they diminished in importance. During the reigns of
Henry III
,
Edward I
, and
Edward II
a new system emerged. Knights in each county were appointed as
Conservator of the Peace
, being required to help keep the King's Peace. Eventually they were given the right to try petty offences which had formerly been tried in the hundred courts. These officers were the forerunners of the modern
magistrates' courts
and
justices of the peace
.
The rise of the town
[
edit
]
The feudal system introduced by the Normans was designed to govern rural areas which could easily be controlled by a lord. Since the system was based on the exploitation of the labour and produce of enserfed peasant farmers, the system was unsuited to governing larger towns, which had more complex economies and a greater population of free (non-serf) people. At the time of the Norman conquest true urban centres were few in England, but during the early medieval period a growing population and increased mercantile activity led to an increase in the importance of towns.
London, by far the largest settlement in England during the medieval period, had been marked out for special status as early as the reign of
Alfred the Great
. William the Conqueror granted London a royal charter in 1075, confirming some of the autonomy and privileges that the city had accumulated during the Saxon period. The charter gave London self-governing status, paying taxes directly to the king in return for remaining outside the feudal system. The citizens were therefore 'burgesses' rather than serfs, and in effect free men. William's son
Henry I
granted charters to other towns, often to establish market towns.
However, it was
Henry II
who greatly expanded the separation of towns from the countryside. He granted around 150 royal charters to towns around England, which were thereafter referred to as '
boroughs
'.
[3]
For an annual rent to the crown, the towns were given various privileges, such as the exemption from feudal dues, the right to hold a market and the rights to levy certain taxes. It should be noted however, that not all market towns established during this period were self-governing.
The self-governing boroughs are the first recognisably modern aspect of local government in England. Generally they were run by a town
corporation
, made up of council
aldermen
, the town 'elders'. Although each corporation was different, they were usually self-elected, new members being co-opted by the existing members. A
mayor
was often elected by the council to serve for a given period. The idea of a town council to run the affairs of an individual town remains an important tenet of local government in England today.
Political representation
[
edit
]
The
English Parliament
developed during the 13th century, and would eventually become the
de facto
governing body for the country. In 1297, it was decreed that the representatives to the
House of Commons
would be allocated based on the administrative units of counties and boroughs — two knights from each shire, and two burgesses from each borough. This system would remain essentially unchanged (despite massive increases in population in some non-borough areas, and the decreased importance of some boroughs) until the
Reform Act of 1832
.
The Later Middle Ages (1300-1500)

The decline of the feudal system
[
edit
]
By the beginning of the 14th century, the feudal system in England was in decline; the
Black Death
(1348-1350) causing mass depopulation, is widely held to signal the effective end of feudalism. Thereafter the relationship between lord and vassal become more a relationship between landlord and tenant. The breakdown of the feudal power left the shires without
de jure
administration. The legal system and sheriffs remained for each county, and what local administration was required was undoubtedly provided by individual parishes or by the local landowners. In an era of very 'small government', the requirement for higher levels of administration was probably minimal. In towns, where more governance would have been required, the town councils continued to manage local affairs.
Counties corporate
[
edit
]
Main article:
County corporate
A further extension of the borough system occurred in the
later medieval period
. While borough status gave towns specific rights
within
counties, some cities petitioned for greater independence. Those cities (or towns) were therefore awarded complete effective independence from the county including their own
sheriffs
,
quarter sessions
and other officials, and were sometimes given governing rights over a swath of surrounding countryside. They were referred to in the form "Town and County of ..." or "City and County of ...", and became known as the counties corporate. They included the City and County of York, Bristol, Canterbury and Chester.
Other counties corporate were created to deal with specific local problems, such as border conflict (in the case of
Berwick-upon-Tweed
) and
piracy
(in the case of
Poole
and
Haverfordwest
).
Later changes in local government (1500-1832)
[
edit
]
In the 1540s the office of
lord-lieutenant
was instituted in each county, effectively replacing feudal lords as the Crown's direct representative in that county. The lieutenants had a military role, previously exercised by the sheriffs, and were made responsible for raising and organising the county
militia
. The county lieutenancies were subsequently given responsibility for the
Volunteer Force
. In 1871 the lieutenants lost their position as head of the militia, and the office became largely ceremonial.

From the 16th century the county was increasingly used as a unit of
local government
. Although 'small government' was still the accepted norm, there were an increasing number of responsibilities which could not be fulfilled by individual communities. The justices of the peace therefore took on various administrative functions known as "county business". This was transacted at the
quarter sessions
, summoned four times a year by the
lord-lieutenant
. By the 19th century the county magistrates exercised powers over the licensing of alehouses, the construction of bridges, prisons and asylums, superintendence of main roads, public buildings and charitable institutions, and the regulation of weights and measures.
[5]
The justices were empowered to levy local taxes to support these activities, and in 1739 under the County Rates Act 1738 (
12 Geo. 2
. c. 29) these were unified as a single "county rate" under the control of a county treasurer.
[6]
In order to build and maintain roads and bridges, a salaried county surveyor was to be appointed.
[7]
These county functions were attached to the legal system, since this was the only body which acted county-wide at that time. However, in this
ad hoc
system the beginnings of county councils, another central element in modern local government, can be observed. The counties themselves remained more-or-less static between the
Law in Wales Acts
of 1535-42, and the
Reform Act 1832
.
Parishes
[
edit
]
The
ecclesiastical parishes
of the
Church of England
also came to play a
de jure
roles in local government from this time. It is probable that this merely confirmed the status quo — people of rural communities would have taken care of what local administration was required. Although the parishes were in no sense governmental organisations, laws were passed requiring parishes to carry out certain responsibilities. From 1555, parishes were responsible for the upkeep of nearby roads. From 1605 parishes were responsible for administering the
Poor Law
, and were required to collect money for their own poor. The parishes were run by parish councils, known as
Select Vestries
. Some such councils were elective, while others were sustained by co-option (existing members filling vacancies by invitation).
The evolution of modern local government (1832-1974)
[

The Great Reform Act 1832
[
edit
]
Main article:
Reform Act 1832
The development of modern government in England began with the
Great Reform Act
of 1832. The impetus for this act was provided by corrupt practices in the House of Commons, and by the massive increase in population occurring during the
Industrial Revolution
. Boroughs and counties were generally able to send two representatives to the Commons. Theoretically, the honour of electing members of Parliament belonged to the wealthiest and most flourishing towns in the kingdom, thus, boroughs that ceased to be successful could be disenfranchised by the Crown.
[8]
In practice, however, many tiny
hamlets
became boroughs, especially between the reigns of
Henry VIII
and
Charles II
. Likewise, boroughs that had flourished during the
Middle Ages
, but had since fallen into decay, were allowed to continue sending representatives to Parliament. The royal prerogative of enfranchising and disfranchising boroughs fell into disuse after the reign of Charles II; as a result, these historical anomalies became set in stone.
[9]
In addition, only male owners of
freehold property
or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county; but those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote in every constituency for which he owned sufficiently valuable property; there was normally no requirement for an individual to actually inhabit a constituency in order to vote there. The size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000.
[10]
This meant that the very wealthy formed the majority of the electorate and could often vote multiple times. In small boroughs that had fallen into decay, there were often only a handful of eligible voters; these “rotten” boroughs were therefore effectively controlled by the local aristocracy.
The Reform Act (and its successors) attempted to address these issues, by abolishing rotten boroughs (as both constituencies and administrative units), enfranchising the industrial towns as new parliamentary boroughs, increasing the proportion of the population eligible to vote, and ending corrupt practices in parliament. Although this did not directly affect local government, it provided impetus to reform outdated, obsolete and unfair practices elsewhere in government.
The Municipal Corporations Act 1835
[
edit
]
Main article:
Municipal Corporations Act 1835
After the reform of parliamentary constituencies the boroughs established by royal charter during the previous seven centuries were reformed by the
Municipal Corporations Act 1835
. The Act required members of town councils (
municipal corporations
) in
England and Wales
to be elected by
ratepayers
and councils to publish their financial accounts.
Before the passing of the Act, the
municipal boroughs
varied depending upon their charters.  In some boroughs, corporations had become self-perpetuating
oligarchies
, with membership of the corporation being for life, and vacancies filled by
co-option
.
The Act reformed 178 boroughs immediately; there remained more than one hundred
unreformed boroughs
, which generally either fell into
desuetude
or were replaced later under the terms of the Act. The last of these were not reformed or abolished until 1886. The
City of London
remains unreformed to the present day. The Act allowed unincorporated towns to petition for incorporation. The industrial towns of the Midlands and North quickly took advantage of this, with
Birmingham
and
Manchester
becoming boroughs as soon as 1838.  Altogether,
62 additional boroughs
were incorporated under the act. With this Act, the boroughs (thereafter “municipal boroughs”) began to take a more noticeably modern and democratic form.
Public welfare reforms
[
edit
]
During the
industrial revolution
there were massive population increases, massively increased
urbanisation
(especially in previously unimportant towns), and the creation of an urban poor, who had no means of subsistence. This created many new problems that the small-scale local government apparatus existing in England could not cope with. Between 1832 and 1888, several laws were passed to try and address these problems.
In 1837 laws were passed allowing rural parishes to group together as
Poor Law Unions
, in order to administer the
Poor Law
more effectively; these unions were able to collect taxes (“rates”) in order to carry out poor-relief. Each union was run by a
Board of Guardians
, partly elected but also including local
Justices of the Peace
. In 1866, all land which was not part of ecclesiastical parishes was formed into Civil Parishes for administration of the poor law. In the municipal boroughs the poor law was administered by the town corporation.
In 1848, a
Public Health Act
was passed, establishing a
Local Board of Health
in towns, to regulate sewerage and the spread of diseases. In municipal boroughs, the town corporation selected the board; in other urban areas, the rate-payers elected the boards. Although the boards had legal powers, they were non-governmental organisations.
In 1873 and 1875, further Public Health Acts (
Public Health Act 1873
&
Public Health Act 1875
) were passed, which established new quasi-governmental organisations to administer both the poor law, and public health and sanitation. Urban
sanitary districts
were created from the
Local Boards of Health
, and continued to be run by in similar fashion. Rural sanitary districts were created from the Poor Law Unions, and, again were similarly governed.
Expansion of the franchise
[
edit
]
In local government elections, unmarried women
ratepayers
received the right to vote in the
Municipal Franchise Act 1869
. This right was confirmed in the
Local Government Act 1894
and extended to include some married women.
[11]
[12]
[13]
By 1900, more than 1 million women were registered to vote in local government elections in England.

Administrative map of
England
in 1931.
By 1888 it was clear that the piecemeal system that had developed over the previous century in response to the vastly increased need for local administration could no longer cope. The
sanitary districts
and
parish councils
had legal status, but were not parts of the mechanism of government. They were run by volunteers, and often there was no-one who could be held responsible for the failure to undertake the required duties. The increased "county business" could not be handled by the
Quarter Sessions
, nor was it appropriate to do so. Finally, there was a desire to see local administration performed by elected officials, as in the reformed municipal boroughs. The
Local Government Act
was therefore the first systematic attempt to impose a standardised system of local government in England.
The Act established county councils as well as newly created areas for those councils, to be known as
administrative counties
. These new administrative counties were based on the
historic counties
,
[15]
which had been used in the local government structure until then. These statutory administrative counties were also to be used for non-administrative functions: "
sheriff
,
lieutenant
,
custos rotulorum
, justices, militia, coroner, or other". With the advent of elected councils, the offices of lord lieutenant and sheriff became largely ceremonial.
The statutory counties formed the basis for the so-called “administrative counties”. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 “counties in themselves”, or “county boroughs”, were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were parts of the statutory counties, but not parts of the administrative counties. The qualifying limit for county borough status was a population of 50,000, although some historic towns, such as
Canterbury
and
Oxford
, were given county borough status despite having lower populations. Each administrative county and county borough was governed by an elected county or borough council, providing services specifically for its own area.
The Act also created a new
County of London
from the urban areas of London, which was a full statutory county by itself with no historical basis. Its new county council absorbed the
Metropolitan Board of Works
, which had been established in 1855 specifically to maintain the infrastructure of London.
By this time many towns possessed liberties and franchises from royal charters and grants that were anomalous, obsolete or otherwise irrelevant, but nevertheless often cherished by the townspeople. Some of these towns were municipal boroughs, in which case the powers remained with the municipal corporation. However, there were others, such as the
Cinque Ports
, which were not boroughs. Rather than abolish these rights and powers, the Act directed that the powers should be taken over by the new
county councils
or
county borough councils
. Although counties corporate were not abolished by the Act, their administration was taken over by their parent administrative county or county borough. The Act therefore abolished them in all but name, though they still appointed their own sheriffs, and each continued to described itself, for purely ceremonial purposes, as a "county and city".
A second Act in 1894 (the
Local Government Act 1894
) created a second tier of local government by dividing all administrative counties into either
rural
or
urban districts
, allowing more localised administration. (The county boroughs were never divided in this way.) The municipal boroughs reformed after 1835 were brought into this system as special cases of urban districts. The urban and rural districts were based on, and incorporated, the
sanitary districts
created in 1875, with adjustments so that districts did not cross any county boundaries.
The Act of 1894 also provided for the establishment of
civil parishes
, separated from the ecclesiastical parishes, to carry on some of their responsibilities, others being transferred to the district or county councils. However, the civil parishes were not a complete third tier of local government, since they were established only for smaller rural settlements with 100 residents or more, while the older urban parish councils were absorbed into the new urban districts.
A final relevant piece of legislation, the
London Government Act 1899
, divided the new
County of London
into districts, known (rather confusingly) as
Metropolitan Boroughs
.
Attempts at reform (1945-1974)
[
edit
]
Initially the new administrative system worked quite well, and several more county boroughs were created in the next decades. However, from 1926 the population requirement increased to 75,000. There was also some concern about the viability of some county boroughs which had declined since 1888. For instance, viability of the county borough of
Merthyr Tydfil
came into question in the 1930s. Due to
a decline in the heavy industries
of the town, by 1932 more than half the male population was unemployed, resulting in very high municipal rates in order to make public assistance payments. At the same time the population of the borough was lower than when it had been created in 1908.
[16]
A
royal commission
was appointed in May 1935 to "investigate whether the existing status of Merthyr Tydfil as a county borough should be continued, and if not, what other arrangements should be made".
[17]
The commission reported the following November, and recommended that Merthyr should revert to the status of a non-county borough, and that public assistance should be taken over by central government. In the event county borough status was retained by the town, with the chairman of the Welsh Board of Health appointed as administrative adviser in 1936.
[18]
Local governments across the United Kingdom lost power after the
Labour Party
won the
1945 general election
and formed its first majority government under
Clement Attlee
. Under Labour's postwar social and economic reforms functions traditionally operated by local governments such as gas, electricity, and hospitals were
nationalized
under regional boards or national government institutions such as the
National Health Service
.
[19]
After the
Second World War
the creation of new county boroughs in
England and Wales
was effectively suspended, pending a local government review. A government
white paper
published in 1945 stated that "it is expected that there will be a number of Bills for extending or creating county boroughs" and proposed the creation of a boundary commission to bring coordination to local government reform. The policy in the paper also ruled out the creation of new county boroughs in
Middlesex
"owing to its special problems".
[20]
The
Local Government Boundary Commission
was appointed on 26 October 1945, under the chairmanship of Sir
Malcolm Trustram Eve
,
[21]
delivering its report in 1947.
[22]
The Commission recommended that towns with a population of 200,000 or more should become one-tier "new counties", with "new county boroughs" having a population of 60,000 - 200,000 being "most-purpose authorities", with the county council of the administrative county providing certain limited services. The report envisaged the creation of 47 two-tiered "new counties", 21 one-tiered "new counties" and 63 "new county boroughs". The recommendations of the Commission extended to a review of the division of functions between different tiers of local government, and thus fell outside its terms of reference, and its report was not acted upon.
The next attempt at reform was by the Local Government Act 1958, which established the
Local Government Commission for England
and the
Local Government Commission for Wales
to carry out reviews of existing local government structures and recommend reforms. Although the Commissions did not complete their work before being dissolved, a few new county boroughs were constituted between 1964 and 1968.
Luton
,
Torbay
, and
Solihull
gained county borough status. Additionally,
Teesside
county borough was formed from the merger of the existing county borough of
Middlesbrough
, and the non-county boroughs of
Stockton-on-Tees
and
Redcar
;
Warley
was formed from the county borough of
Smethwick
and the non-county boroughs of
Oldbury
and
Rowley Regis
; and
West Hartlepool
was merged with
Hartlepool
. Following these changes, there were a total of 79 county boroughs in England. The Commission also recommended the downgrading of
Barnsley
to be a non-county borough, but this was not carried out. The commission did succeed in merging two pairs of small administrative counties to form
Huntingdon and Peterborough
and
Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely
.
In 1965 a major reform in London was undertaken in reflection of the size and specific problems of the city. The administrative counties of London and Middlesex were abolished, and their area were joined with parts of
Essex
,
Surrey
and
Kent
to form into a new county of
Greater London
. Greater London was divided into 32 London Boroughs, replacing both the old Metropolitan Boroughs of Inner London (the area of the old
London County Council
) and the county boroughs and urban districts of Outer London.
The Local Government Commission was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the
Redcliffe-Maud commission
). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier
unitary authorities
for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of
Merseyside
,
Selnec
(Greater Manchester) and
West Midlands
(
Birmingham
and the
Black Country
), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils. This report was accepted by the
Labour Party
government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the
Conservative Party
won the
June 1970 general election
, and on a manifesto that committed them to a two-tier structure.
The Local Government Act 1972
[

Administrative map of
England
in 1974.
Further information:
Local Government Act 1972
The reforms arising from the Local Government Act of 1972 resulted in the most uniform and simplified system of local government used in England so far. They effectively wiped away everything that had gone before and built an administrative system from scratch. All previous administrative districts - statutory counties, administrative counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, counties corporate, civil parishes - were abolished, with the exceptions of Greater London and the
Isles of Scilly
.
The aim of the Act was to establish a uniform two-tier system across the country. New counties were created to cover the entire country. Many of these were based on the
historic counties
, but there were some major changes, especially in the North. The tiny county of
Rutland
was joined with
Leicestershire
;
Cumberland
,
Westmorland
and the
Furness
exclave of
Lancashire
were fused into the new county of Cumbria;
Herefordshire
and
Worcestershire
were joined to form
Hereford & Worcester
; the three ridings of
Yorkshire
were replaced by
North
,
South
and
West Yorkshire
, along with
Humberside
. The Act also created six new metropolitan counties, modelled on
Greater London
, to address the problems of administering large conurbations; these were
Greater Manchester
,
Merseyside
,
Tyne & Wear
,
West Yorkshire
,
South Yorkshire
and the
West Midlands
. The new counties of
Avon
(the city of
Bristol
, North
Somerset
and South
Gloucestershire
),
Cleveland
(the
Teesside
area) and
Humberside
were designed with the idea of uniting areas based on river estuaries.
Each of the new counties was then endowed with a county council to provide certain county-wide services such as
policing
,
social services
and
public transport
. The Act substituted the new counties "for counties of any other description" for purposes of law.
[23]
The new counties therefore replaced the statutory counties created in 1888 for judicial and ceremonial purposes (such as
lieutenancy
,
custodes rotulorum
,
shrievalty
,
commissions of the peace
and
magistrates'
courts);
[24]
[25]
and replaced administrative counties and county boroughs for administrative purposes.
The second tier of the local government varied between the
metropolitan
and
non-metropolitan counties
. The metropolitan counties were divided into
metropolitan boroughs
, whilst the non-metropolitan counties were divided into
districts
. The metropolitan boroughs had greater powers than the districts, sharing some of the county council responsibilities with the metropolitan county councils, and having control of others that districts did not (e.g.
education
was administered by the non-metropolitan county councils, but by the metropolitan borough councils). The metropolitan boroughs were supposed to have a minimum population of 250,000 and districts 40,000; in practice some exceptions were allowed for the sake of convenience.
Where
municipal boroughs
still existed, they were dissolved. However, the charter grants made to those boroughs (where transfer had not already occurred), were generally transferred to the district or metropolitan borough which contained area in question. Districts which succeeded to such powers were permitted to style themselves 'borough councils' as opposed to 'district councils' - however, the difference was purely ceremonial. The powers of some municipal boroughs were transferred to either civil parish councils, or to
charter trustees
; see
Borough status in the United Kingdom
for details.
The act also dealt with
civil parishes
. These were maintained in rural areas, but those existing in large urban areas were abolished. Conversely, the Act actually provided the legislation such that the whole country could be divided into parishes if this was desirable at some point in the future. However, at the time urban parishes were strongly discouraged. However, since 1974, several urban areas have applied for and received parish councils. Much of the country remains unparished, since the parish councils are not a necessary part of local government, but exist to give civic identity to smaller settlements.
The new system of local government came into force on 1 April 1974, but in the event the uniformity proved to be short lived.
Further reform (1974-)
[
edit

Abolition of the metropolitan county councils
[
edit
]
Main article:
Local Government Act 1985
This uniform two-tier system lasted only 12 years. In 1986, the metropolitan county councils and Greater London were abolished under the
Local Government Act 1985
. This restored autonomy (in effect the old county borough status) to the metropolitan and London boroughs. While the abolition of the Greater London Council was highly controversial, the abolition of the MCCs was less so. The government's stated reason for the abolition of the MCCs, in its 1983 white paper
Streamlining the cities
, was based on efficiency and their overspending. However the fact that all of the county councils were controlled at the time by the opposition Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of
NALGO
described it as a "completely cynical manoeuvre".
[26]
[27]
This created an unusual situation where seven counties had, administratively, ceased to exist, but the area had not been annexed to any other county. The metropolitan counties thus continued to exist as geographical entities, and lived a shadowy semi-existence, since services such as the police force continued to call themselves e.g. 'Greater Manchester Police'. This gave rise to the concept of the '
ceremonial county
'. From a geographical and ceremonial point of view, England continues to be made up of the counties established in 1974, with one or two exceptions (see below). These counties still have a lord lieutenant and sheriff, and are therefore usually referred to as ceremonial counties.
Local Government Act (1992)

Ceremonial Counties of England
By the 1990s, it was apparent that the 'one-size fits all' approach of the 1974 reforms did not work equally well in all cases. The consequent loss of education, social services and libraries to county control, was strongly regretted by the larger towns outside the new
metropolitan counties
, such as Bristol, Plymouth, Stoke, Leicester and Nottingham.
[28]
[29]
The abolition of metropolitan county councils in 1986 had left the metropolitan boroughs operating as 'unitary' (i.e., only one tier) authorities, and other large cities (and former county boroughs) wished for a return to unitary governance.
Map showing counties and unitary authorities from 1998. Pink (non-metropolitan) and green (metropolitan and London) areas were left unchanged. Yellow areas are unitary authorities created as a result of the review, whilst blue areas are remaining two-tier counties reduced by the creation of unitary authorities.
The Local Government Act (1992) established a commission (
Local Government Commission for England
) to examine the issues, and make recommendations on where unitary authorities should be established. It was considered too expensive to make the system entirely unitary, and also there would doubtlessly be cases where the two-tier system functioned well. The commission recommended that many counties be moved to completely unitary systems; that some cities become unitary authorities, but that the remainder of their parent counties remain two-tier; and that in some counties the
status quo
should remain.
The first major changes to be recommended were for unpopular new counties created in 1974. Three of these had artificially united the areas around rivers/estuaries (
Cleveland
,
Humberside
and
Avon
), and the commission recommended that they be split into four new unitary authorities. This effectively gave a 'metropolitan borough-like' status to the cities of
Hull
,
Bristol
and
Middlesbrough
. It also restored the
East Riding of Yorkshire
as a
de facto
county.
Rutland
was reestablished as a unitary authority, thus regaining its cherished 'independence' from Leicestershire. The merged county of
Hereford & Worcester
was restored to
Herefordshire
(as a unitary authority) and
Worcestershire
(as a two-tier authority).
The only other county to be moved to a wholly unitary system was
Berkshire
; the county council was abolished and 6 unitary authorities established in its place. In
County Durham
,
North Yorkshire
,
Lancashire
,
Cheshire
,
Staffordshire
,
Nottinghamshire
,
Derbyshire
,
Leicestershire
,
Cambridgeshire
,
Wiltshire
,
Hampshire
,
Devon
,
Dorset
,
East Sussex
,
Shropshire
,
Kent
,
Essex
,
Bedfordshire
and
Buckinghamshire
, one or two major towns/cities were established as unitary authorities, with the rest of the county remaining two tier. All other counties were unaffected.
Whilst these reforms had removed unpopular new counties, they created a rather haphazard situation, which was for the most part like the old counties & county borough system; but in which areas taken to make the abolished new counties was not returned to the historic county. Thus, for instance, the non-urban unitary authority of, e.g.,
Cleveland
&
Redcar
was not, administratively, in any county. In recognition of these problems, the
Lieutenancies Act 1997
was passed. This firmly separated all local authority areas (whether unitary or two-tier), from the geographical concept of a county as  high level spatial unit. The lieutenancies it established became known as
ceremonial counties
, since they were no longer administrative divisions. The counties represent a compromise between the
historic counties
and the counties established in 1974. They are as 1974 except that; north Lincolnshire returned to
Lincolnshire
and the remainder of Humberside became East Riding of Yorkshire; Bristol is established as a county; the remainder of Avon returned to
Somerset
and
Gloucestershire
; Cleveland was split between County Durham and North Yorkshire; Herefordshire and Worcestershire were separated; and Rutland was re-established as a county.
Creation of additional unitary authorities after 2000
[
edit

The years after 2000 saw further substantial changes, leading to a still more varied (some might say haphazard) system. Various counties were unitarised: some by abolition of districts (e.g. Cornwall, Northumberland), others by geographical division into two or more unitary authorities (e.g. Bedfordshire).
The Labour governments of
Tony Blair
and
Gordon Brown
(1997-2010) had planned to introduce eight regional assemblies around England, to devolve power to the
English regions
. This would have sat alongside the devolved
Welsh
,
Scottish
and
Northern Irish
Assemblies. In the event, only a
London Assembly
(and directly elected
Mayor
) was established. The rejection of a
referendum on the creation of a North East England Assembly in 2004
led to those plans being scrapped.
Local enterprise partnerships and local authority leaders' boards

Main article:
Local enterprise partnership
2009 structure of
local government in England
; since 2009 the regional angencies were abolished, more unitary authorities have been created and combined authorities created.
The abolition of
regional development agencies
and the creation of
local enterprise partnerships
were announced as part of the
June 2010 United Kingdom budget
.
[30]
On 29 June 2010 a letter was sent from the
Department of Communities and Local Government
and the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
to local authority and business leaders, inviting proposals to replace regional development agencies in their areas by 6 September 2010.
[31]
Many of the
regional development agencies
were transferred to the unelected
Local authority leaders' boards
following abolition in March 2010, but funding was also cut for them by the Government in July 2010. These boards now act as voluntary regional associations for local authority leaders, funded by local authorities and its membership consisting of the leaders of local authorities.
On 7 September 2010, details were released of 56 proposals for local enterprise partnerships that had been received.
[32]
On 6 October 2010, during the Conservative Party Conference, it was revealed that 22 had been given the provisional 'green light' to proceed and others may later be accepted with amendments.
[33]
24 bids were announced as successful on 28 October 2010. This later increased to 39, as of 2012.
Combined authorities
[

Further information:
Combined authority
The abolition of
metropolitan county councils
and
regional development agencies
meant that there were no  local government bodies with strategic authority over the major urban areas England. In 2010 the Government accepted a proposal from the
Association of Greater Manchester Authorities
to establish a Greater Manchester Combined Authority as an indirectly elected, top tier, strategic authority for
Greater Manchester
. Following the unsuccessful
English mayoral referendums
in 2012 combined authorities have been used as an alternative means to receive additional powers and funding as part of 'city deals' to metropolitan areas. In 2014 indirectly elected combined authorities were established for the metropolitan counties of
South Yorkshire
and
West Yorkshire
, and two combined authorities were established which each covered a metropolitan county and adjacent non-metropolitan districts:  the
Liverpool City Region Combined Authority
for
Merseyside
and the
Borough of Halton
unitary authority, and the
North East Combined Authority
for
Tyne and Wear
and the unitary authorities of
County Durham
and
Northumberland
.  Further combined authorities are proposed for a number of areas.
The City of London
[
edit
]
Further information:
City of London
The one exception to the general trends in the development of local government in England has been (and remains) the City of London. This refers only to the actual City of London (as distinct from the Greater London area, and the nearby
City of Westminster
). In the UK,
city status
is granted by royal charter; whilst in common parlance 'city' (lower case) is used to mean a large urban area, 'City' refers specifically to a specific legal entity. Thus, what might be considered the 'city of London' contains both the 'City of London' and 'City of Westminster'. The City of London, covering a relatively small area, (often called 'The Square Mile' or just 'The City') is the main financial district of London, and only houses c.7,200 permanent residents.
For a variety of reasons, including a singular relationship with the Crown, the City of London has remained an archaic oddity within the English system of local government. As discussed above, the City of London was administered separately from the reign of
Alfred the Great
onwards, and was very quickly granted self-governance after the Norman conquest. Until 1835, the City of London was a fairly normal (municipal)
borough
, run by the
Lord Mayor
and
Corporation of London
, which had also received
county corporate
status (and thus was technically 'The County and City of London'). However, unlike most other cities and boroughs of the time, London was not reformed by the
Municipal Corporations Act 1835
; and unlike the other unreformed cities and boroughs of the time, never has been.
In the major local government reforms of 1888 the City of London, unlike other municipal boroughs and counties corporate, was not made into either a
county borough
or a district within an
administrative county
. Nor indeed was it placed within a statutory county at that time, remaining administratively separate from the
County of London
(though within it geographically). Nor was the status of the City of London as a county corporate abolished in 1974, unlike the (by then ceremonial) status of the other counties corporate, nor was the City of London included in any of the London boroughs created in 1965; although at that time it did become included within the
Greater London
county, as a
de facto
33rd borough in the second tier of local government. The City of London has continued in name and administration to be a municipal borough and county corporate since 1888, whilst acting as a
de facto
county borough until 1965, and since 1965 as a
de facto
London borough.
When Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, the City of London reverted to being a unitary authority (like the London boroughs). Under the terms of the
Lieutenancies Act 1997
, it is now classed as a ceremonial county by itself, separate from the Greater London ceremonial county (in to which the 32 London Boroughs are grouped). However, the City of London does now form part of the new Greater London
region
(which is the modern Greater London ceremonial county, plus the City of London; i.e., the post-1965 Greater London administrative area), and as such falls under the strategic management of the
Greater London Authority
.
The current system retains non-democratic elements to the election of the local government. The primary justification for this is that the services provided by the City of London are used by approximately 450,000 workers who dwell outside the City, and only by 7200 residents (a ratio not found elsewhere in the UK). In reflection of this, businesses based in the City can
vote
in the local elections, a practice abolished elsewhere in England in 1969.
[34]
A map of the wards of the City as they were in the late 19th century.
The City of London has a
different type of ward
to those used elsewhere in the country - another remnant of ancient local government found in the "square mile" of the City. The wards are permanent entities that constitute the City and are more than just electoral districts.

Donald John Trump
(born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th
president of the United States
from 2017 to 2021.
Trump received a BS in economics from the
University of Pennsylvania
in 1968, and his father named him president of his real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the
Trump Organization
and expanded its operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business reversals in the late twentieth century, he successfully launched various side ventures that required little capital, mostly by licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series
The Apprentice
. He and his businesses have been plaintiff or defendant in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.
Trump won the
2016 presidential election
as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee
Hillary Clinton
while losing the popular vote.
[a]
During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the first U.S. president with no prior military or government experience. The
2017-2019 special counsel investigation
established that
Russia had interfered in the 2016 election
to favor Trump's campaign. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many
false and misleading statements
during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist and many as misogynistic.
As president, Trump
ordered a travel ban
on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and implemented a
policy of family separations
for migrants detained at the U.S. border. He weakened environmental protections, rolling back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
, which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the
individual health insurance mandate
penalty of the
Affordable Care Act
. He appointed
Neil Gorsuch
,
Brett Kavanaugh
, and
Amy Coney Barrett
to the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed
Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade agreement, the
Paris Agreement
on climate change, and the
Iran nuclear deal
. He met with North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un
three times but made no progress on denuclearization. He reacted slowly to the
COVID-19 pandemic
, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments.
Trump lost the
2020 presidential election
to
Joe Biden
. He refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud, and
attempted to overturn the results
by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the
U.S. Capitol
, which many of them then
attacked
, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count.
Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he tried to pressure Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached in December by the
House of Representatives
for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress; he was acquitted by the
Senate
in February 2020. The House impeached him a second time in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection, and the Senate acquitted him the next month. Scholars and historians
rank Trump
as one of the worst presidents in American history.
[1]
[2]
Since leaving office, Trump has remained heavily involved in the Republican Party. In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the
2024 presidential election
. In March 2023, a
Manhattan grand jury indicted
him on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. In June, a
Miami federal grand jury indicted
him on 40 felonies related to his
handling of classified documents
. In August, a
Washington, D.C., federal grand jury indicted
him on four felony counts of conspiracy and obstruction related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Later in August, a
Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury indicted him
on 19 charges for racketeering and other felonies committed in an effort to overturn the state's 2020 election results. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Personal life
Early life
Trump at the
New York Military Academy
in 1964
Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at
Jamaica Hospital
in
Queens
, New York City,
[3]
the fourth child of
Fred Trump
, a
Bronx
-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants, and
Mary Anne MacLeod Trump
, an immigrant from Scotland. Trump grew up with older siblings

, a private boarding school,
[7]
and, in 1964, he enrolled at
Fordham University
. Two years later, he transferred to the
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania
, graduating in May 1968 with a
Bachelor of Science
in economics.
[8]
[9]
In 2015, Trump's lawyer
Michael Cohen
threatened Trump's colleges, high school, and the
College Board
with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.
[10]
While in college, Trump obtained four student
draft
deferments during the
Vietnam War
era.
[11]
In 1966, he was deemed fit for military service based upon a medical examination, and in July 1968, a local draft board classified him as eligible to serve.
[12]
In October 1968, he was classified
1-Y
, a conditional medical deferment,
[13]
and in 1972, he was reclassified
4-F
due to
bone spurs
, permanently disqualifying him from service.

(born 1981), and
Eric
(born 1984). Ivana became a
naturalized United States citizen
in 1988.
[16]
The couple divorced in 1990, following Trump's affair with actress
Marla Maples
.
[17]
Trump and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter,
Tiffany
(born 1993), who was raised by Marla in California.
[18]
In 2005, Trump married Slovenian model
Melania Knauss
.
[19]
They have one son, Barron (born 2006).
[20]
Melania gained U.S. citizenship in 2006.
[21]
Religion
Trump went to
Sunday school
and was
confirmed
in 1959 at the
First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica
, Queens.
[22]
[23]
In the 1970s, his parents joined the
Marble Collegiate Church
in Manhattan, which belongs to the
Reformed Church in America
.
[22]
[24]
The pastor at Marble,
Norman Vincent Peale
,
[22]
ministered to the family until his death in 1993.
[24]
Trump has described him as a mentor.
[25]
In 2015, the church stated that Trump was not an active member.
[23]
In 2019, he appointed his personal pastor, televangelist
Paula White
, to the White House
Office of Public Liaison
.
[26]
In 2020, he said he identified as a
non-denominational Christian
.
[27]
Health habits
Trump has called golfing his "primary form of exercise" but usually does not walk the course.
[28]
He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes exercise depletes the body's energy "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy".
[29]
In 2015, Trump's campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician,
Harold Bornstein
, stating that Trump would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".
[30]
In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three Trump agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on the doctor's office.

Ronald Reagan
and First Lady
Nancy Reagan
In 1982, Trump made the initial
Forbes
list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $606 million in 2022).
[32]
His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.
[33]
After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the
FEC
in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.
[34]
Forbes
estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.
[35]
In their 2021 billionaires ranking, Trump's net worth was estimated to be $2.4 billion (1,299th in the world).
[36]
Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump called him in 1984, pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named "
John Barron
". Greenberg said that Trump, speaking as "Barron", falsely asserted that he owned more than 90 percent of his father's business to get a higher ranking for himself on the
Forbes
400
list of wealthy Americans. Greenberg also wrote that
Forbes
had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the
Forbes
400 rankings of 1982, 1983, and 1984.
[37]
Trump has often said he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.
[38]
He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.
[39]
[40]
In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the
New York State Department of Taxation and Finance
started an investigation.
[40]
His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.
[41]
[42]
Forbes
estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23 million to $3 million.
[43]
Contrary to his claims of financial health and business acumen,
Trump's tax returns
from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million (equivalent to $1.76 billion in 2022).
[44]
[45]
[32]
In 2020, the
New York Times
obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that Trump reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and had, since 2010, deferred declaring $287 million in forgiven debt as taxable income. His income mainly came from his share in
The Apprentice
and businesses in which he was a minority partner, and his losses mainly from majority-owned businesses. Much income was in
tax credits
for his losses, which let him avoid annual income tax payments or lower them to $750. During the 2010s, Trump balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on
Trump Tower
(due in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.
[46]
As of October 2021, Trump had over $1.3 billion in total debts, much of which is secured by his assets.
[47]
In 2020, he owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including
Bank of China
,
Deutsche Bank
, and
UBS
, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.

Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia
Real estate
Trump Tower in
Midtown Manhattan
Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.
[49]
[50]
In 1971, he became president of the company and began using the
Trump Organization
as an
umbrella brand
.
[51]
Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for
Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses, the
Plaza Hotel
in Manhattan, the casinos in
Atlantic City, New Jersey
, and the
Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts
company.
[52]
Manhattan developments
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict
Commodore Hotel
, adjacent to
Grand Central Terminal
.
[53]
The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for Trump by his father who also, jointly with
Hyatt
, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.
[50]
[54]
The hotel reopened in 1980 as the
Grand Hyatt Hotel
,
[55]
and that same year, Trump obtained rights to develop
Trump Tower
, a
mixed-use
skyscraper in
Midtown Manhattan
.
[56]
The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's
PAC
and was Trump's primary residence until 2019.
[57]
[58]
In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.
[59]
The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.
[60]
In 1995, Trump defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a humiliating
restructuring
that allowed Trump to avoid personal bankruptcy.
[61]
[62]
The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they "all agreed that he’d be better alive than dead."
[62]
In 1996, Trump acquired the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at
40 Wall Street
, later rebranded as the Trump Building, and renovated it.
[63]
In the early 1990s, Trump won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the
Lincoln Square
neighborhood near the
Hudson River
. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, Trump sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who were able to finance the project's completion,
Riverside South
.
[64]
Atlantic City casinos
Entrance of the
Trump Taj Mahal
in
Atlantic City
In 1984, Trump opened
Harrah's at Trump Plaza
, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the
Holiday Corporation
.
[65]
It was unprofitable, and Trump paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.
[66]
In 1985, Trump bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it
Trump Castle
.
[67]
His wife Ivana managed it until 1988.
[68]
Both casinos filed for
Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in 1992.
[69]
Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the
Trump Taj Mahal
. It was financed with $675 million in
junk bonds
and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.
[70]
[71]
Trump filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, Trump gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.
[72]
To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the
Trump Shuttle
airline; his
megayacht
, the
Trump Princess
, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.
[73]
In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.
[74]
THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the
Trump Castle
in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership.
[65]
He remained chairman until 2009.
[75]
Mar-a-Lago
Main article:
Mar-a-Lago
In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in
Palm Beach, Florida
.
[76]
In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.
[77]
In 2019, Trump declared Mar-a-Lago his primary residence.
[58]
Golf courses
Main article:
Donald Trump and golf
The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.
[78]
It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.
[78]
[79]
Trump visited a Trump Organization property on 428 (nearly one in three) of the 1,461 days of his presidency and is estimated to have played 261 rounds of golf, one every 5.6 days.
[80]
Licensing of the Trump brand
See also:
List of things named after Donald Trump
The Trump name has been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel,
adult learning courses
, and home furnishings.
[81]
[82]
According to an analysis by
The Washington Post
, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.
[83]
By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.
[81]
Side ventures

In September 1983, Trump purchased the
New Jersey Generals
, a team in the
United States Football League
. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule (when they competed with the
NFL
for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an
antitrust suit
against the organization.
[84]
[85]
Trump's businesses have hosted several boxing matches at the
Atlantic City Convention Hall
, adjacent to and promoted as taking place at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.
[86]
[87]
In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the
Tour de Trump
cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the
Tour de France
or the
Giro d'Italia
.
[88]
From 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while
suggesting that he intended to take over
the company and then sold his shares for a profit,
[44]
leading some observers to think he was engaged in
greenmail
.
[89]
The New York Times
found that Trump initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but later "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously".
[44]
In 1988, Trump purchased the
Eastern Air Lines Shuttle
, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $940 million in 2022)
[32]
in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline
Trump Shuttle
and operated it until 1992.
[90]
Trump defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.
[91]
The airline was eventually sold to US Airways.
[90]
In 1992, Trump, his siblings
Maryanne
, Elizabeth, and
Robert
, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20-50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups.
[40]
[92]
The increased costs were used as justification to get state approval for increasing the rents of Trump's rent-stabilized units.
[40]
Trump's star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame
From 1996 to 2015, Trump owned all or part of the
Miss Universe
pageants, including
Miss USA
and
Miss Teen USA
.
[93]
[94]
Due to disagreements with
CBS
about scheduling, he took both pageants to
NBC
in 2002.
[95]
[96]
In 2007, Trump received a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame
for his work as producer of Miss Universe.
[97]
NBC and
Univision
dropped the pageants from their broadcasting lineups in June 2015.
[98]
Trump University
Main article:
Trump University
In 2004, Trump co-founded
Trump University
, a company that sold real estate training courses priced from $1,500 to $35,000.
[99]
After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of the word "university" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.
[100]
In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.
[101]
In addition, two
class actions
were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.
[102]
[103]
[104]
Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, Trump agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.
[105]
Foundation
Main article:
Donald J. Trump Foundation
The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a
private foundation
established in 1988.
[106]
[107]
In the foundation's final years, its funds mostly came from donors other than Trump, who did not donate any personal funds to the charity from 2009 until 2014.
[108]
The foundation gave to health-care- and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.
[109]
In 2016,
The Washington Post
reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible
tax evasion
.
[110]
Also in 2016, the
New York Attorney General
determined the foundation to be in violation of state law for soliciting donations and ordered it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.
[111]
Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.
[112]
In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.
[113]
[114]
In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.
[115]
In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.

Legal affairs and bankruptcies
Main article:
Legal affairs of Donald Trump
Roy Cohn
was Trump's
fixer
, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.
[118]
According to Trump, Cohn sometimes waived fees due to their friendship.
[118]
In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the United States government for $100 million (equivalent to $659 million in 2022)
[32]
over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case went forward, ultimately resulting in a settlement.
[119]
In 1975, an agreement was struck requiring Trump's properties to furnish the
New York Urban League
with a list of all apartment vacancies, every week for two years, among other things.
[120]
Cohn introduced political consultant
Roger Stone
to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.
[121]
According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by
USA Today
in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.
[122]
While Trump has not filed for
personal bankruptcy
, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection six times between 1991 and 2009.
[123]
They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced Trump's shares in the properties.
[123]
During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.
[124]
After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.
[125]
After the
January 6 United States Capitol attack
, the bank decided not to do business with Trump or his company in the future.

Using
ghostwriters
, Trump has produced up to 19 books on business, financial, or political topics under his name.
[127]
His first book,
The Art of the Deal
(1987), was a
New York Times
Best Seller
. While Trump was credited as co-author, the entire book was written by
Tony Schwartz
.
[128]
According to
The New Yorker
, "The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon."

Trump had a sporadic relationship with the
professional wrestling
promotion
WWE
since the late 1980s.
[131]
He appeared at
WrestleMania 23
in 2007 and was inducted into the celebrity wing of the
WWE Hall of Fame in 2013
.
[132]
Trump at a
New York Mets
baseball game in 2009
Starting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated
Howard Stern Show
.
[133]
He also had his own short-form talk radio program called
Trumped!
(one to two minutes on weekdays) from 2004 to 2008.
[134]
[135]
From 2011 until 2015, he was a weekly unpaid guest commentator on
Fox & Friends
.
[136]
[137]
From 2004 to 2015, Trump was co-producer and host of reality shows
The Apprentice
and
The Celebrity Apprentice
. Trump played a flattering, highly fictionalized version of himself as a superrich and successful chief executive who eliminated contestants with the
catchphrase
"You're fired". The shows remade his image for millions of viewers nationwide.
[138]
[139]
With the related licensing agreements, they earned him more than $400 million which he invested in largely unprofitable businesses.
[140]
In February 2021, Trump resigned from the
Screen Actors Guild
he had been a member of since 1989 rather than face a disciplinary committee hearing for inciting the January 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and for his "reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists".
[141]
Two days later, the union permanently barred him from readmission.

expressing his views on foreign policy and on how to eliminate the federal budget deficit.
[146]
He ruled out running for local office but not for the presidency.
[145]
In 1988, he approached
Lee Atwater
, asking to be put into consideration to be Republican nominee
George H. W. Bush
's running mate. Bush found the request "strange and unbelievable".
[147]
Presidential campaigns (2000-2016)
In 2000, Trump
ran in the California and Michigan primaries
for nomination as the Reform Party candidate for the
2000 United States presidential election
but withdrew from the race in February 2000.
[148]
[149]
[150]

Trump's fame and provocative statements earned him an unprecedented amount of
free media coverage
, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.
[156]
He adopted the phrase "truthful hyperbole", coined by his ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, to describe his public speaking style.
[128]
[157]
His campaign statements were often opaque and suggestive,
[158]
and a record number of them were false.
[159]
[160]
[161]
The
Los Angeles Times
wrote, "Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has."
[162]
[163]
Trump said he disdained
political correctness
and frequently made claims of
media bias
.
[164]

[168]
He became the front-runner in March 2016
[169]
and was declared the presumptive Republican nominee in May.
[170]
Hillary Clinton
led Trump in
national polling averages
throughout the campaign, but, in early July, her lead narrowed.

and
Trumpism
Trump's political positions and rhetoric were
right-wing populist
.
[176]
[177]
[178]
Politico
described them as "eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory", quoting a health-care policy expert at the
American Enterprise Institute
as saying that his political positions were "a total random assortment of whatever plays publicly".
[179]
NBC News
counted "141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues" during his campaign.
[180]
Trump questioned the need for
NATO
and espoused views that were described as isolationist,
non-interventionist
, and protectionist.
[181]
His campaign platform emphasized renegotiating
U.S.-China relations
and free trade agreements such as
NAFTA
and the
Trans-Pacific Partnership
, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building
a new wall
along the
U.S.-Mexico border
. Other campaign positions included pursuing
energy independence
while opposing climate change regulations such as the
Clean Power Plan
and the
Paris Agreement
, modernizing and expediting
services for veterans
, repealing and replacing the
Affordable Care Act
, abolishing
Common Core
education standards,
investing in infrastructure
, simplifying the
tax code
while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing
tariffs
on imports by companies that offshore jobs. He advocated a largely
non-interventionist
approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries
[182]
to pre-empt domestic
Islamic terrorism
, and aggressive military action against the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
. He described NATO as "obsolete".
[183]
[184]
Trump helped bring
far-right
fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.
[185]
Trump was slow to disavow an endorsement from
David Duke
after he was questioned about it during a
CNN
interview on February 28, 2016.
[186]
Duke enthusiastically supported Trump and said he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to "take our country back".
[187]
[188]
In August 2016, Trump hired
Steve Bannon
, the executive chairman of
Breitbart News
—described by Bannon as "the platform for the alt-right"—as his campaign CEO.
[189]
The
alt-right
movement coalesced around and supported Trump's candidacy, due in part to its
opposition to multiculturalism
and
immigration
.

Tax returns of Donald Trump
Trump's FEC-required reports listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $315 million.
[34]
[193]
Trump did not release
his tax returns
, contrary to the practice of every major candidate since 1976 and his promises in 2014 and 2015 to do so if he ran for office.
[194]
[195]
He said his tax returns were being
audited
, and that his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.
[196]
After a lengthy court battle to block release of his tax returns and other records to the
Manhattan district attorney
for a criminal investigation, including two appeals by Trump to the
United States Supreme Court
, in February 2021 the high court allowed the records to be released to the prosecutor for review by a grand jury.
[197]
[198]
In October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from
The New York Times
. They show that Trump had declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years.
[199]
Election to the presidency
Main article:
2016 United States presidential election
2016 electoral vote results. Trump won 304-227.
On November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged
electoral votes
versus 232 for Clinton, though, after elector
defections on both sides
, the official count was ultimately 304 to 227.
[200]
Trump received nearly 2.9 million fewer popular votes than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president
while losing the popular vote
.
[201]
Trump also became the only president who
neither served in the military nor held any government office
prior to becoming president.
[202]
Trump's victory was a
political upset
.
[203]
Polls had consistently shown Clinton with a
nationwide
—though diminishing—lead, as well as an advantage in most of the
competitive states
. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated, while Clinton's had been overestimated.
[204]
Trump won 30 states, including
Michigan
,
Pennsylvania
, and
Wisconsin
, states which had been considered a
blue wall
of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the
District of Columbia
. Trump's victory marked the return of an
undivided
Republican government—a Republican White House combined with Republican control of both chambers of
Congress
.
[205]
Women's March
in Washington on January 21, 2017
Trump's election victory sparked
protests
in major U.S. cities in the days following the election.
[206]
[207]
On the day after Trump's inauguration, an estimated 2.6 million people worldwide, including an estimated half million in Washington, D.C., protested against Trump in the
Women's Marches
.

Trump was inaugurated
on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed
six executive orders
, which authorized: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare"), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the
Mexico City policy
, advancement of the
Keystone XL
and
Dakota Access Pipeline
construction projects, reinforcement of border security, and a planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.
[209]
Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law
Jared Kushner
became his
assistant
and
senior advisor
, respectively.
[210]
[211]
Conflicts of interest
Before being inaugurated, Trump moved his businesses into a
revocable trust
run by his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and a business associate.
[212]
[213]
Though he said he would eschew "new foreign deals", the Trump Organization pursued expansions of its operations in Dubai, Scotland, and the Dominican Republic. Trump continued to profit from his businesses and to know how his administration's policies affected his businesses.
[213]
[214]
He was sued for violating the
Domestic
and
Foreign Emoluments Clauses
of the
U.S. Constitution
, marking the first time that the clauses had been substantively litigated.
[215]
One case was dismissed in lower court.
[216]
Two were dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court as moot after the end of Trump's term.
[217]
Domestic policy
Economy
Main article:
Economic policy of the Donald Trump administration
Trump speaks to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017.
Trump took office at the height of the longest
economic expansion
in American history,
[218]
which began in June 2009 and continued until February 2020, when the
COVID-19 recession
began.
[219]
In December 2017, Trump signed the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
. The bill had been passed by both Republican-controlled chambers of Congress without any Democratic votes. It reduced tax rates for businesses and individuals, with business tax cuts to be permanent and individual tax cuts set to expire after 2025, and eliminated the penalty associated with
Affordable Care Act
's individual mandate.
[220]
[221]
The Trump administration claimed that the act would either increase tax revenues or pay for itself by prompting economic growth. Instead, revenues in 2018 were 7.6 percent lower than projected.
[222]
Despite a campaign promise to eliminate the national debt in eight years, Trump approved large increases in government spending and the 2017 tax cut. As a result, the federal budget deficit increased by almost 50 percent, to nearly $1 trillion in 2019.
[223]
Under Trump, the
U.S. national debt
increased by 39 percent, reaching $27.75
trillion by the end of his term, and the U.S.
debt-to-GDP ratio
hit a post-World War II high.
[224]
Trump also failed to deliver the $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan on which he had campaigned.
[225]
Trump is the only modern U.S. president to leave office with a smaller workforce than when he took office, by 3 million people.
[218]
Climate change, environment, and energy
Main article:
Environmental policy of the Donald Trump administration
Trump rejects the
scientific consensus on climate change
.
[226]
[227]
He reduced the budget for renewable energy research by 40 percent and reversed Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change.
[228]
In June 2017, Trump announced the
withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement
, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.
[229]
Trump aimed to boost the production and exports of
fossil fuels
.
[230]
[231]
Natural gas expanded under Trump, but coal continued to decline.
[232]
[233]
Trump rolled back more than 100 federal environmental regulations, including those that curbed
greenhouse gas emissions
, air and water pollution, and the use of toxic substances. He weakened protections for animals and environmental standards for federal infrastructure projects, and expanded permitted areas for drilling and resource extraction, such as allowing
drilling in the Arctic Refuge
. Trump's actions while president have been called "a very aggressive attempt to rewrite our laws and reinterpret the meaning of environmental protections".
[234]
Deregulation
In January 2017, Trump signed
Executive Order 13771
, which directed that, for every new regulation, federal agencies "identify" two existing regulations for elimination, though it did not require elimination.
[235]
He dismantled many federal regulations on health,
[236]
[237]
labor,
[238]
[237]
and the environment,
[239]
[237]
among other topics. Trump signed 14
Congressional Review Act
resolutions repealing federal regulations, including a bill that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to buy guns.
[240]
During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended, or reversed ninety federal regulations,
[241]
often "after requests by the regulated industries".
[242]
The
Institute for Policy Integrity
found that 78 percent of Trump's proposals were blocked by courts or did not prevail over litigation.
[243]
Health care
During his campaign, Trump vowed to repeal and replace the
Affordable Care Act
(ACA).
[244]
In office, he scaled back the Act's implementation through executive orders
13765
[245]
and
13813
.
[246]
Trump expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail"; his administration cut the ACA
enrollment period
in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.
[247]
[248]
Trump falsely claimed he saved the coverage of pre-existing conditions provided by the ACA.
[249]
In June 2018, the Trump administration
joined 18 Republican-led states in arguing before the Supreme Court
that the elimination of the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate had rendered the ACA unconstitutional.
[250]
[251]
If they had succeeded, it would have eliminated
health insurance coverage
for up to 23 million Americans.
[250]
During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to protect funding for Medicare and other social safety-net programs, but in January 2020, he suggested he was willing to consider cuts to such programs.
[252]
In response to the opioid epidemic, Trump signed legislation in 2018 to increase funding for drug treatments, but was widely criticized for failing to make a concrete strategy. U.S. opioid overdose deaths declined slightly in 2018, but surged to a record 50,052 deaths in 2019.
[253]
Social issues
Main article:
Social policy of Donald Trump
Trump barred organizations that provide abortions or abortion referrals from receiving federal funds.
[254]
He said he supported "traditional marriage" but considered the
nationwide legality
of
same-sex marriage
a "settled" issue.
[255]
In March 2017, his administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections against
discrimination of LGBT people
.
[256]
Trump has said he is
opposed
to
gun control
in general, although his views have shifted over time.
[257]
After several
mass shootings
during his term, he said he would propose legislation to curtail gun violence, but he abandoned that effort in November 2019.
[258]
His administration took an
anti-marijuana position
, revoking
Obama-era policies
that provided protections for states that legalized marijuana.
[259]
Trump is a long-time advocate of
capital punishment
.
[260]
[261]
Under his administration, the
federal government executed
13 prisoners, more than in the previous 56 years combined and after a 17-year moratorium.
[262]
In 2016, Trump said he supported the use of interrogation torture methods such as
waterboarding
[263]
[264]
but later appeared to recant this due to the opposition of Defense Secretary
James Mattis
.
[265]
Pardons and commutations
Further information:
List of people granted executive clemency by Donald Trump
Trump granted 237 requests for clemency, fewer than all presidents since 1900 with the exception of
George H. W. Bush
and
George W. Bush
.
[266]
Only 25 of them had been vetted by the Justice Department's
Office of the Pardon Attorney
; the others were granted to people with personal or political connections to him, his family, and his allies, or recommended by celebrities.
[267]
[268]
From 2017 to 2019, he pardoned, amongst others, former Navy sailor
Kristian Saucier
, who was convicted of taking classified photographs of classified areas inside a submarine;
[269]
and
right-wing
commentator
Dinesh D'Souza
.
[270]
Following a request by celebrity
Kim Kardashian
, Trump commuted the life sentence of
Alice Marie Johnson
, who had been convicted of drug trafficking.
[271]
Trump also pardoned or reversed the sentences of three American servicemen convicted or accused of committing war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq.
[272]
In November and December 2020, Trump pardoned four
Blackwater
private security contractors
convicted of killing Iraqi civilians in the 2007
Nisour Square massacre
;
[273]
white-collar criminals
Michael Milken
and
Bernard Kerik
;
[274]
daughter Ivanka's father-in-law
Charles Kushner
;
[268]
and five people convicted as a result of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Among them were
Michael Flynn
; Roger Stone, whose 40-month sentence for lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstruction he had already commuted in July; and
Paul Manafort
.
[275]
In his last full day in office, Trump granted 73 pardons, including to Steve Bannon and Trump fundraiser
Elliott Broidy
, and commuted 70 sentences.

Lafayette Square protester removal and photo op
Main article:
Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church
Trump and group of officials and advisors on the way from White House complex to St. John's Church
On June 1, 2020, federal law-enforcement officials used batons, rubber bullets,
pepper spray
projectiles,
stun grenades
, and smoke to remove a largely peaceful crowd of protesters from
Lafayette Square
, outside the
White House
.
[277]
[278]
Trump then walked to
St. John's Episcopal Church
, where protesters had set a small fire the night before; he posed for photographs holding a Bible, with senior administration officials later joining him in photos.
[277]
[279]
Trump said on June 3 that the protesters were cleared because "they tried to burn down the church [on May 31] and almost succeeded", describing the church as "badly hurt".
[280]
Religious leaders condemned the treatment of protesters and the photo opportunity itself.
[281]
Many retired military leaders and defense officials condemned Trump's proposal to use the U.S. military against anti-police-brutality protesters.
[282]
Immigration
Main article:
Immigration policy of Donald Trump
Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build
a wall
on the
Mexico-United States border
to restrict illegal movement and vowed Mexico would pay for it.
[283]
He pledged to deport millions of
illegal immigrants residing in the United States
,
[284]
and criticized
birthright citizenship
for incentivizing "
anchor babies
".
[285]
As president, he frequently described illegal immigration as an "invasion" and conflated immigrants with the criminal gang
MS-13
,
[286]
though available research shows
undocumented immigrants
have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans.
[287]
[288]
Trump attempted to drastically escalate immigration enforcement, including implementing harsher immigration enforcement policies against asylum seekers from Central America than any modern U.S. president.
[289]
[290]
From 2018 onward, Trump
deployed nearly 6,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border
[291]
to stop most Central American migrants from seeking U.S. asylum. In 2020, his administration widened the
public charge rule
to further restrict immigrants who might use government benefits from getting permanent residency via
green cards
.
[292]
Trump reduced the number of
refugees admitted
into the U.S. to record lows. When Trump took office, the annual limit was 110,000; Trump set a limit of 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year and 15,000 in the 2021 fiscal year.
[293]
[294]
Additional restrictions implemented by the Trump administration caused significant bottlenecks in processing refugee applications, resulting in fewer refugees accepted compared to the allowed limits.
[295]
Travel ban
Main article:
Trump travel ban
Further information:
Executive Order 13769
and
Executive Order 13780
Following the
2015 San Bernardino attack
, Trump proposed to ban
Muslim
foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.
[296]
He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a "proven history of terrorism".
[297]
On January 27, 2017, Trump signed
Executive Order 13769
, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order took effect immediately and without warning, causing confusion and chaos at airports.
[298]
[299]
Protests against the ban
began at airports the next day.
[298]
[299]
Legal challenges
to the order resulted in
nationwide preliminary injunctions
.
[300]
A March 6
revised order
, which excluded Iraq and gave other exemptions, again was blocked by federal judges in three states.
[301]
[302]
In a
decision in June 2017
, the
Supreme Court
ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a "credible claim of a
bona fide
relationship with a person or entity in the United States".
[303]
The temporary order was replaced by
Presidential Proclamation 9645
on September 24, 2017, which restricted travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further banned travelers from North Korea and Chad, along with certain Venezuelan officials.
[304]
After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4, 2017,
[305]
and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June 2019 ruling.
[306]
Family separation at border
Main article:
Trump administration family separation policy
Children sitting within a wire mesh compartment in the
Ursula detention facility
in
McAllen, Texas
, June 2018
The Trump administration separated more than 5,400 children of migrant families from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, a sharp increase in the number of family separations at the border starting from the summer of 2017.
[307]
[308]
In April 2018, the Trump administration announced a "
zero tolerance
" policy whereby every adult suspected of
illegal entry
would be criminally prosecuted.
[309]
This resulted in family separations, as the migrant adults were put in criminal detention for prosecution, while their children were separated as unaccompanied alien minors.
[310]
Administration officials described the policy as a way to deter illegal immigration.
[311]
The policy of family separations was unprecedented in previous administrations and sparked public outrage.
[311]
[312]
Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law, blaming Democrats, despite the separations being his administration's policy.
[313]
[314]
[315]
Although Trump originally argued that the separations could not be stopped by an executive order, he acceded to intense public objection and signed an executive order on June 20, 2018, mandating that migrant families be detained together unless "there is a concern" doing so would pose a risk to the child.
[316]
[317]
On June 26, 2018, Judge
Dana Sabraw
concluded that the Trump administration had "no system in place to keep track of" the separated children, nor any effective measures for family communication and reunification;
[318]
Sabraw ordered for the families to be reunited and family separations stopped except in limited circumstances.
[319]
After the federal-court order, the Trump administration separated more than a thousand migrant children from their families; the
ACLU
contended that the Trump administration had abused its discretion and asked Sabraw to more narrowly define the circumstances warranting separation.
[308]
Trump wall and government shutdown
Main articles:
Trump wall
and
2018-2019 United States federal government shutdown
Trump examines border wall prototypes in
Otay Mesa, California
.
One of Trump's central campaign promises was to build a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) border wall to Mexico and have Mexico pay for it.
[320]
By the end of his term, the U.S. had built "40 miles [64 km] of new primary wall and 33 miles [53 km] of secondary wall" in locations where there had been no barriers and 365 miles (587 km) of primary or secondary border fencing replacing dilapidated or outdated barriers.
[321]
In 2018, Trump refused to sign any
appropriations bill
from Congress unless it allocated $5.6 billion in funds for the border wall,
[322]
resulting in the federal government partially shutting down for 35 days from December 2018 to January 2019, the
longest U.S. government shutdown in history
.
[323]
[324]
Around 800,000 government employees were
furloughed
or worked without pay.
[325]
Trump and Congress ended the shutdown by approving temporary funding that provided delayed payments to government workers but no funds for the wall.
[323]
The shutdown resulted in an estimated permanent loss of $3 billion to the economy, according to the
Congressional Budget Office
.
[326]
About half of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown, and Trump's approval ratings dropped.
[327]
To prevent another imminent shutdown in February 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a funding bill that included $1.375 billion for 55 miles (89 km) of bollard border fencing.
[328]
Trump also declared a
National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States
, intending to divert $6.1 billion of funds Congress had allocated to other purposes.
[328]
Trump
vetoed
a
joint resolution
to overturn the declaration, and the Senate voted against a
veto override
.
[329]
Legal challenges to the diversion of $2.5 billion originally meant for the
Department of Defense
's drug interdiction efforts
[330]
[331]
and $3.6 billion originally meant for military construction
[332]
[333]
were unsuccessful.

Trump described himself as a "nationalist"
[334]
and his foreign policy as "
America First
".
[335]
His foreign policy was marked by praise and support of
populist
,
neo-nationalist
, and authoritarian governments.
[336]
Hallmarks of foreign relations during Trump's tenure included unpredictability and uncertainty,
[335]
a lack of a consistent foreign policy,
[337]
and strained and sometimes antagonistic relationships with the U.S.'s European allies.
[338]
He criticized
NATO allies
and privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should
withdraw from the alliance
.
[339]
[340]
Trade
See also:
Trump tariffs
Trump withdrew the U.S. from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) negotiations,
[341]
imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports,
[342]
and launched a
trade war with China
by sharply increasing tariffs on 818 categories (worth $50 billion) of Chinese goods imported into the U.S.
[343]
While Trump said that import tariffs are paid by China into the
U.S. Treasury
, they are paid by American companies that import goods from China.
[344]
Although he pledged during the campaign to significantly reduce the U.S.'s large
trade deficits
, the trade deficit in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, "was the largest monthly deficit since July 2008".
[345]
Following a 2017-2018 renegotiation, the
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement
(USMCA) became effective in July 2020 as the successor to NAFTA.
[346]
Russia
Putin and Trump shaking hands at the
G20 Osaka summit
, June 2019
The Trump administration "water[ed] down the toughest penalties the U.S. had imposed on Russian entities" after its
2014 annexation of Crimea
.
[347]
[348]
Trump withdrew the U.S. from the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty
, citing alleged Russian non-compliance,
[349]
and supported a potential return of Russia to the
G7
.
[350]
Trump repeatedly praised and rarely criticized Russian president
Vladimir Putin
[351]
[352]
but opposed some actions of the Russian government.
[353]
[354]
After he met Putin at the
Helsinki Summit
in July 2018, Trump drew bipartisan criticism for accepting Putin's denial of
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election
, rather than accepting the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies.
[355]
[356]
[357]
Trump did not discuss alleged
Russian bounties
offered to
Taliban
fighters for attacking American soldiers in
Afghanistan
with Putin, saying both that he doubted the intelligence and that he was not briefed on it.
[358]
China
Before and during his presidency, Trump repeatedly accused China of taking unfair advantage of the U.S.
[359]
As president, Trump
launched a trade war against China
that was widely characterized as a failure,
[360]
[361]
[362]
sanctioned
Huawei
for its alleged ties to Iran,
[363]
significantly increased visa restrictions on Chinese students and scholars,
[364]
and classified China as a
currency manipulator
.
[365]
Trump also juxtaposed verbal attacks on China with praise of
Chinese Communist Party
leader
Xi Jinping
,
[366]
which was attributed to trade war negotiations with the leader.
[367]
After initially praising China for
its handling
of the
COVID-19 pandemic
,
[368]
he began a campaign of criticism over its response starting in March 2020.
[369]
Trump said he resisted punishing China for
its human rights abuses
against ethnic minorities in the northwestern
Xinjiang
region for fear of jeopardizing trade negotiations.
[370]
In July 2020,
the Trump administration imposed sanctions
and visa restrictions against senior Chinese officials, in response to expanded mass
detention camps
holding more than a million of the country's
Uyghur
Muslim
ethnic minority.
[371]
North Korea

In 2017, when
North Korea's nuclear weapons
were increasingly seen as a serious threat,
[372]
Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning that North Korean aggression would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen".
[373]
[374]
In 2017, Trump declared that he wanted North Korea's "complete denuclearization", and engaged in
name-calling
with leader
Kim Jong Un
.
[373]
[375]
After this period of tension, Trump and Kim exchanged at least 27 letters in which the two men described a warm personal friendship.
[376]
[377]
Trump met Kim three times:
in Singapore
in 2018,
in Hanoi
in 2019, and
in the Korean Demilitarized Zone
in 2019.
[378]
Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader or to set foot on North Korean soil.
[378]
Trump also lifted some U.S.
sanctions against North Korea
.
[379]
However, no
denuclearization
agreement was reached,
[380]
and talks in October 2019 broke down after one day.
[381]
While conducting no nuclear tests since 2017, North Korea continued to build up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
[382]
[383]
Afghanistan

U.S. troop numbers in
Afghanistan
increased from 8,500 in January 2017 to 14,000 a year later,
[384]
reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.
[385]
In February 2020, the Trump administration signed a conditional
peace agreement with the Taliban
, which called for the
withdrawal of foreign troops
in 14 months "contingent on a guarantee from the Taliban that Afghan soil will not be used by terrorists with aims to attack the United States or its allies" and for the U.S. to seek the release of 5,000
Taliban
imprisoned by the Afghan government.
[386]
[387]
[388]
By the end of Trump's term, 5,000 Taliban had been released, and, despite the Taliban continuing attacks on Afghan forces and integrating
Al-Qaeda
members into its leadership, U.S. troops had been reduced to 2,500.
[388]
Israel
Trump supported many of the policies of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
.
[389]
Under Trump, the U.S.
recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
[390]
and
Israeli sovereignty
over the

Saudi Arabia
Trump, King
Salman of Saudi Arabia
, and Egyptian president
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
at the
2017 Riyadh summit
in Saudi Arabia
Trump actively supported the
Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
against the
Houthis
and in 2017 signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to
Saudi Arabia
,
[394]
In 2018, the U.S. provided limited intelligence and logistical support for the intervention.
[395]
[396]
Following the
2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities
, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed on
Iran
, Trump approved the deployment of 3,000 additional U.S. troops, including fighter squadrons, two
Patriot batteries
, and a
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
system (THAAD), to Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates
.
[397]
Syria
Trump ordered
missile strikes in April 2017
and
in April 2018
against the Assad regime in Syria, in retaliation for the
Khan Shaykhun
and
Douma chemical attacks
, respectively.
[398]
[399]
In December 2018, Trump declared "we have won against ISIS", contradicting Department of Defense assessments, and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria.
[400]
[401]
The next day, Mattis resigned in protest, calling his decision an abandonment of the U.S.'s
Kurdish allies
who played a key role in fighting ISIS.
[402]
One week after his announcement, Trump said he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.
[403]
Trump and Turkish President
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
at the White House in May 2017
In October 2019, after Trump spoke to Turkish president
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
,
U.S. troops in northern Syria
were withdrawn from the area and Turkey
invaded northern Syria
, attacking and
displacing
American-allied
Kurds
in the area.
[404]
Later that month, the U.S. House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, condemned Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for "abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe".
[405]
[406]
Iran
After an Iranian missile test on January 29, 2017, and Houthi attacks on Saudi warships, the Trump administration sanctioned 12 companies and 13 individuals suspected of being involved in Iran's missile program.
[407]
In May 2018, Trump
withdrew the United States
from the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA), the 2015 agreement between Iran, the U.S., and five other countries that lifted most economic sanctions against Iran in return for Iran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program.
[408]
[409]
Analysts determined that, after the United States's withdrawal, Iran moved closer to developing a nuclear weapon.
[410]
In January 2020, Trump ordered
a U.S. airstrike
that killed Iranian general
Qasem Soleimani
, who had planned nearly every significant operation by Iranian forces over the past two decades.
[411]
Trump threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites, including some "important to Iran & the Iranian culture", if Iran retaliated.
[412]
The threat to hit cultural sites was seen as illegal and both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. would not attack such sites, but would "follow the laws of armed conflict" and "behave inside the system".
[413]
Iran did retaliate with
ballistic missile strikes against two U.S. airbases
in Iraq.
[410]
On the same day, amid the heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Iran accidentally
[414]
shot down
Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752
after takeoff from Tehran airport.
[415]
[414]
[416]
In August 2020, the Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to trigger a mechanism that was part of the agreement that would have led to the return of U.N. sanctions against Iran.
[417]
Personnel
Main articles:
Political appointments by Donald Trump
and
Cabinet of Donald Trump
The Trump administration had a high turnover of personnel, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.
[418]
As of early July 2018
, 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left
[419]
and 141 staffers had left in the previous year.
[420]
Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.
[421]
Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Flynn (after just 25 days in office), and Press Secretary
Sean Spicer
.
[421]
Close personal aides to Trump including Bannon,
Hope Hicks
,
John McEntee
, and
Keith Schiller
quit or were forced out.
[422]
Some, including Hicks and McEntee, later returned to the White House in different posts.
[423]
Trump publicly disparaged several of his former top officials, calling them incompetent, stupid, or crazy.
[424]
Trump had four
White House chiefs of staff
, marginalizing or pushing out several.
[425]
Reince Priebus
was replaced after seven months by retired Marine general
John F. Kelly
.
[426]
Kelly resigned in December 2018 after a tumultuous tenure in which his influence waned, and Trump subsequently disparaged him.
[427]
Kelly was succeeded by
Mick Mulvaney
as acting chief of staff; he was replaced in March 2020 by
Mark Meadows
.
[425]
On May 9, 2017, Trump
dismissed FBI director James Comey
. While initially attributing this action to Comey's conduct in the investigation about
Hillary Clinton's emails
, Trump said a few days later that he was concerned with Comey's roles in the ongoing Trump-Russia investigations, and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.
[428]
At a private conversation in February, Trump said he hoped Comey would drop the investigation into Flynn.
[429]
In March and April, Trump asked Comey to "lift the cloud impairing his ability to act" by saying publicly that the FBI was not investigating him.
[429]
[430]
Turnover was relatively high within the Trump Cabinet.
[422]
Trump lost three of his 15 original cabinet members within his first year.
[431]
Health and Human Services secretary
Tom Price
was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft.
[431]
[422]
Environmental Protection Agency administrator
Scott Pruitt
resigned in 2018 and Secretary of the Interior
Ryan Zinke
in January 2019 amid multiple investigations into their conduct.
[432]
[433]
Trump was slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying many of the positions are unnecessary. In October 2017, there were still hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.
[434]
By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled (61 percent) and Trump had no nominee for 264 (37 percent).
[435]
Judiciary

Trump appointed 226
Article III judges
, including 54 to the
courts of appeals
and
three
to the
Supreme Court
:
Neil Gorsuch
,
Brett Kavanaugh
, and
Amy Coney Barrett
.
[436]
Trump's Supreme Court nominees were noted as having politically shifted the Supreme Court to the right.
[437]
[438]
[439]
[440]
In the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged that
Roe v. Wade
would be overturned "automatically" if he were elected and provided the opportunity to appoint two or three pro-life justices. Trump later took credit when
Roe
was overturned in
Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization
; all three of his Supreme Court nominees voted with the majority.
[441]
[442]
[443]
Trump disparaged courts and judges he disagreed with, often in personal terms, and questioned the judiciary's constitutional authority. Trump's attacks on the courts drew rebukes from observers, including sitting federal judges, concerned about the effect of Trump's statements on the
judicial independence
and public confidence in the judiciary.

Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States
In December 2019,
COVID-19
erupted in
Wuhan
, China; the
SARS-CoV-2 virus
spread worldwide within weeks.
[447]
[448]
The first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported on January 20, 2020.
[449]
The outbreak was officially declared a public health emergency by
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary
Alex Azar
on January 31, 2020.
[450]
Trump's public statements on COVID-19 were at odds with his private statements. In February 2020 Trump publicly asserted that the outbreak in the U.S. was less deadly than influenza, was "very much under control", and would soon be over.
[451]
At the same time he acknowledged the opposite in a private conversation with
Bob Woodward
. In March 2020, Trump privately told Woodward that he was deliberately "playing it down" in public so as not to create panic.
[452]
[453]
Initial response
Trump was slow to address the spread of the disease, initially dismissing the threat and ignoring persistent public health warnings and calls for action from health officials within his administration and Secretary Azar.
[454]
[455]
Throughout January and February he focused on economic and political considerations of the outbreak, and largely ignored the danger.
[456]
By mid-March, most global financial markets had
severely contracted
in response to the emerging pandemic.
[457]
On March 6, Trump signed the
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act
into law, which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies.
[458]
On March 11, the
World Health Organization
(WHO) recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a
pandemic
,
[447]
and Trump announced partial travel restrictions for most of Europe, effective March 13.
[459]
That same day, he gave his first serious assessment of the virus in a nationwide Oval Office address, calling the outbreak "horrible" but "a temporary moment" and saying there was no financial crisis.
[460]
On March 13, he declared a
national emergency
, freeing up federal resources.
[461]
Trump falsely claimed that "anybody that wants a test can get a test", despite the availability of tests being severely limited.
[462]
In September 2019, the Trump administration terminated
United States Agency for International Development
's
PREDICT
program, a $200 million
epidemiological
research program initiated in 2009 to provide early warning of pandemics abroad.
[463]
[464]
The program trained scientists in sixty foreign laboratories to detect and respond to viruses that have the potential to cause pandemics. One such laboratory was the Wuhan lab that first identified the virus that causes COVID-19. After revival in April 2020, the program was given two 6-month extensions to help fight COVID-19 in the U.S. and other countries.
[465]
[466]
On April 22, Trump signed an executive order restricting some forms of
immigration to the United States
.
[467]
In late spring and early summer, with infections and death counts continuing to rise, he adopted a strategy of blaming the states for the growing pandemic, rather than accepting that his initial assessments of the course of the pandemic were overly optimistic or his failure to provide presidential leadership.
[468]
White House Coronavirus Task Force
Trump conducts a COVID-19 press briefing with members of the
White House Coronavirus Task Force
on March 15, 2020.
Trump established the
White House Coronavirus Task Force
on January 29, 2020.
[469]
Beginning in mid-March, Trump held a daily task force press conference, joined by medical experts and other administration officials,
[470]
sometimes disagreeing with them by promoting unproven treatments.
[471]
Trump was the main speaker at the briefings, where he praised his own response to the pandemic, frequently criticized rival presidential candidate Joe Biden, and denounced the press.
[470]
[472]
On March 16, he acknowledged for the first time that the pandemic was not under control and that months of disruption to daily lives and a recession might occur.
[473]
His repeated use of the terms "Chinese virus" and "China virus" to describe COVID-19 drew criticism from health experts.
[474]
[475]
[476]
By early April, as the pandemic worsened and amid criticism of his administration's response, Trump refused to admit any mistakes in his handling of the outbreak, instead blaming the media, Democratic state governors, the previous administration, China, and the
World Health Organization
(WHO).
[477]
The daily coronavirus task force briefings ended in late April, after a briefing at which Trump suggested the dangerous idea of injecting a disinfectant to treat COVID-19;
[478]
the comment was widely condemned by medical professionals.
[479]
[480]
In early May, Trump proposed the phase-out of the coronavirus task force and its replacement with another group centered on reopening the economy. Amid a backlash, Trump said the task force would "indefinitely" continue.
[481]
By the end of May, the coronavirus task force's meetings were sharply reduced.
[482]
World Health Organization
Prior to the pandemic, Trump criticized the
World Health Organization
(WHO) and other international bodies, which he asserted were taking advantage of U.S. aid.
[483]
His administration's proposed 2021 federal budget, released in February, proposed reducing WHO funding by more than half.
[483]
In May and April, Trump accused the WHO of "severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus" and alleged without evidence that the organization was under Chinese control and had enabled the Chinese government's concealment of the origins of the pandemic.
[483]
[484]
[485]
He then announced that he was withdrawing funding for the organization.
[483]
Trump's criticisms and actions regarding the WHO were seen as attempts to distract attention from his own mishandling of the pandemic.
[483]
[486]
[487]
In July 2020, Trump announced the formal withdrawal of the United States from the WHO effective July 2021.
[484]
[485]
The decision was widely condemned by health and government officials as "short-sighted", "senseless", and "dangerous".
[484]
[485]
Testing
Further information:
COVID-19 testing in the United States
In June and July, Trump said several times that the U.S. would have fewer cases of coronavirus if it did less testing, that having a large number of reported cases "makes us look bad".
[488]
[489]
The CDC guideline at the time was that any person exposed to the virus should be "quickly identified and tested" even if they are not showing symptoms, because asymptomatic people can still spread the virus.
[490]
[491]
In August 2020 the CDC quietly lowered its recommendation for testing, advising that people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not showing symptoms, "do not necessarily need a test". The change in guidelines was made by HHS political appointees under Trump administration pressure, against the wishes of CDC scientists.
[492]
[493]
The day after this
political interference
was reported, the testing guideline was changed back to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested.
[493]
Pressure to abandon pandemic mitigation measures
In April 2020, Republican-connected groups organized
anti-lockdown protests
against the measures state governments were taking to combat the pandemic;
[494]
[495]
Trump encouraged the protests on
Twitter
,
[496]
even though the targeted states did not meet the Trump administration's own guidelines for reopening.
[497]
In April 2020, he first supported, then later criticized,
Georgia
Governor
Brian Kemp
's plan to reopen some nonessential businesses.
[498]
Throughout the spring he increasingly pushed for ending the restrictions as a way to reverse the damage to the country's economy.
[499]
Trump often refused to
wear a face mask
at public events, contrary to his own administration's April 2020 guidance that Americans should wear masks in public
[500]
and despite nearly unanimous medical consensus that masks are important to preventing the spread of the virus.
[501]
By June, Trump had said masks were a "double-edged sword"; ridiculed Biden for wearing masks; continually emphasized that mask-wearing was optional; and suggested that wearing a mask was a political statement against him personally.
[501]
Trump's contradiction of medical recommendations weakened national efforts to mitigate the pandemic.
[500]
[501]
Despite record numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. from mid-June onward and an increasing percentage of positive test results, Trump largely continued to downplay the pandemic, including his false claim in early July 2020 that 99 percent of COVID-19 cases are "totally harmless".
[502]
[503]
He also began insisting that all states should open schools to in-person education in the fall despite a July spike in reported cases.
[504]
Political pressure on health agencies
Main article:
Trump administration political interference with science agencies
Trump repeatedly pressured federal health agencies to take actions he favored,
[492]
such as approving unproven treatments
[505]
[506]
or speeding up the approval of vaccines.
[506]
Trump administration political appointees at HHS sought to control CDC communications to the public that undermined Trump's claims that the pandemic was under control. CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication.
[507]
[508]
Trump alleged without evidence that FDA scientists were part of a "
deep state
" opposing him, and delaying approval of vaccines and treatments to hurt him politically.
[509]
Outbreak at the White House

On October 2, 2020, Trump tweeted that he had tested positive for
COVID-19
.
[510]
[511]
His wife, their son Barron, and numerous staff members and visitors also became infected.
[512]
[513]
Later that day
Trump was hospitalized
at
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center
, reportedly due to labored breathing and a fever. He was treated with antiviral and experimental antibody drugs and a steroid. He returned to the White House on October 5, still struggling with the disease.
[514]
During and after his treatment he continued to downplay the virus.
[512]
In 2021, it was revealed that his condition had been far more serious; he had dangerously low blood oxygen levels, a high fever, and lung infiltrates, indicating a severe case of the disease.
[513]
Effects on the 2020 presidential campaign
By July 2020, Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had become a major issue for the 2020 presidential election.
[515]
Biden sought to make the pandemic the central issue of the election.
[516]
Polls suggested voters blamed Trump for his pandemic response
[515]
and disbelieved his rhetoric concerning the virus, with an
Ipsos
/
ABC News
poll indicating 65 percent of respondents disapproved of his pandemic response.
[517]
In the final months of the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that the U.S. was "rounding the turn" in managing the pandemic, despite increasing numbers of reported cases and deaths.
[518]
A few days before the November 3 election, the United States reported more than 100,000 cases in a single day for the first time.
[519]
Investigations
After he assumed office, Trump was the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition, and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his
private businesses
, personal taxes, and
charitable foundation
.
[520]
There were 30 investigations of Trump, including ten federal criminal investigations, eight state and local investigations, and twelve congressional investigations.
[521]
In April 2019, the
House Oversight Committee
issued
subpoenas
seeking financial details from Trump's banks, Deutsche Bank and
Capital One
, and his accounting firm,
Mazars USA
. Trump then sued the banks, Mazars, and committee chair
Elijah Cummings
to prevent the disclosures.
[522]
In May,
DC District Court
judge
Amit Mehta
ruled that Mazars must comply with the subpoena,
[523]
and judge
Edgardo Ramos
of the
Southern District Court of New York
ruled that the banks must also comply.
[524]
[525]
Trump's attorneys appealed the rulings.
[526]
In September 2022, the committee and Trump agreed to a settlement about Mazars, and the accounting firm began turning over documents.

[528]
and a company set up by Cohen paid
Playboy
model
Karen McDougal
and
adult film actress
Stormy Daniels
for keeping silent about their alleged affairs with Trump between 2006 and 2007.
[529]
Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to breaking campaign finance laws, saying he had arranged both payments at the direction of Trump to influence the presidential election.
[530]
Trump denied the affairs and claimed he was not aware of Cohen's payment to Daniels, but he reimbursed him in 2017.
[531]
[532]
Federal prosecutors asserted that Trump had been involved in discussions regarding non-disclosure payments as early as 2014.
[533]
Court documents showed that the FBI believed Trump was directly involved in the payment to Daniels, based on calls he had with Cohen in October 2016.
[534]
[535]
Federal prosecutors closed the investigation in 2019,
[536]
but the
Manhattan District Attorney
subpoenaed the Trump Organization and AMI for records related to the payments
[537]
and Trump and the Trump Organization for eight years of tax returns.
[538]
In November 2022,
The New York Times
reported that Manhattan prosecutors were "newly optimistic about building a case" against Trump.

Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election
and
Steele dossier
In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the
CIA
, the
FBI
, and the
NSA
, represented by the
Director of National Intelligence
—jointly stated with "
high confidence
" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.
[540]
[541]
In March 2017, FBI Director
James Comey
told Congress, "[T]he FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts."
[542]
Many suspicious
[543]
links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies
were discovered and the relationships between Russians and "team Trump" were widely reported by the press.
[544]
[545]
Manafort, one of Trump's campaign managers, worked from December 2004 to February 2010 to help pro-Russian politician
Viktor Yanukovych
win the Ukrainian presidency.
[546]
Other Trump associates, including Flynn and Stone, were connected to Russian officials.
[547]
[548]
Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.
[549]
Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.
[550]
[551]
On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador
Sergey Kislyak
about sanctions that were imposed that same day; Flynn later resigned in the midst of controversy over whether he misled Pence.
[552]
Trump told Kislyak and
Sergei Lavrov
in May 2017 he was unconcerned about Russian interference in U.S. elections.
[553]
Trump and his allies promoted
a conspiracy theory
that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election—which was also promoted by Russia to
frame
Ukraine.
[554]
After the
Democratic National Committee
was hacked, Trump first claimed it withheld "its server" from the FBI (in actuality there were more than 140 servers, of which digital copies were given to the FBI); second, that
CrowdStrike
, the company that investigated the servers, was Ukraine-based and Ukrainian-owned (in actuality, CrowdStrike is U.S.-based, with the largest owners being American companies); and third that "the server" was hidden in Ukraine. Members of the Trump administration spoke out against the conspiracy theories.
[555]
FBI Crossfire Hurricane and 2017 counterintelligence investigations
In July 2016, the FBI launched an investigation, codenamed
Crossfire Hurricane
, into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.
[556]
After Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's personal and
business dealings with Russia
.
[557]
Crossfire Hurricane was transferred to the Mueller investigation,
[558]
but deputy attorney general
Rod Rosenstein
ended the investigation into Trump's direct ties to Russia while giving the bureau the false impression that Mueller would pursue the matter.
[559]
[560]
Mueller investigation
Main articles:
Mueller special counsel investigation
,
Mueller report
, and
Criminal charges brought in the Mueller special counsel investigation
In May 2017,
Deputy Attorney General
Rod Rosenstein appointed
Robert Mueller
, a former
director of the FBI
,
special counsel
for the
Department of Justice
(DOJ), ordering him to "examine 'any links and/or coordination between the Russian government' and the Trump campaign". He privately told Mueller to restrict the investigation to criminal matters "in connection with Russia's 2016 election interference".
[559]
The special counsel also investigated whether Trump's
dismissal of James Comey
as FBI director constituted obstruction of justice
[561]
and the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Turkey
,
Qatar
, Israel, and China.
[562]
Trump sought to fire Mueller and shut down the investigation multiple times but backed down after his staff objected or after changing his mind.
[563]
In March 2019, Mueller concluded his investigation and gave
his report
to Attorney General
William Barr
.
[564]
Two days later, Barr
sent a letter to Congress
purporting to summarize the report's main conclusions. A federal court, as well as Mueller himself, said Barr mischaracterized the investigation's conclusions and, in so doing, confused the public.
[565]
[566]
[567]
Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the investigation exonerated him; the Mueller report expressly stated that it did not exonerate him.
[568]
A redacted version of the report was publicly released in April 2019. It found that Russia interfered in 2016 to favor Trump's candidacy and hinder Clinton's.
[569]
Despite "numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign", the report found that the prevailing evidence "did not establish" that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russian interference.
[570]
[571]
The report revealed sweeping Russian interference
[571]
and detailed how Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged it, believing "[they] would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts".
[572]
[573]
[574]
[575]
The report also detailed multiple acts of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but did not make a "traditional prosecutorial judgment" on whether Trump broke the law, suggesting that Congress should make such a determination.
[576]
[577]
Investigators decided they could not "apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes" as an
Office of Legal Counsel
opinion stated that a sitting president could not be indicted,
[578]
and investigators would not accuse him of a crime when he cannot clear his name in court.
[579]
The report concluded that Congress, having the authority to take action against a president for wrongdoing, "may apply the obstruction laws".
[578]
The House of Representatives subsequently launched an
impeachment inquiry
following the
Trump-Ukraine scandal
, but did not pursue an article of impeachment related to the Mueller investigation.
[580]

First impeachment

First impeachment of Donald Trump
and
Trump-Ukraine scandal
Members of House of Representatives vote on two
articles of impeachment
(
)
, December 18, 2019.
In August 2019, a
whistleblower
filed a complaint with the
Inspector General of the Intelligence Community
about a July 25 phone call between Trump and President of Ukraine
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
, during which Trump had pressured Zelenskyy to investigate CrowdStrike and Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son
Hunter
.
[589]
The whistleblower said that the White House had attempted to cover up the incident and that the call was part of a wider campaign by the Trump administration and Trump attorney
Rudy Giuliani
that may have included withholding financial aid from Ukraine in July 2019 and canceling Pence's May 2019 Ukraine trip.
[590]
House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi
initiated
a formal impeachment inquiry
on September 24.
[591]
Trump then confirmed that he withheld military aid from Ukraine, offering contradictory reasons for the decision.
[592]
[593]
On September 25, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the phone call which confirmed that, after Zelenskyy mentioned purchasing American anti-tank missiles, Trump asked him to discuss investigating Biden and his son with Giuliani and Barr.
[589]
[594]
The testimony of multiple administration officials and former officials confirmed that this was part of a broader effort to further Trump's personal interests by giving him an advantage in the upcoming presidential election.
[595]
In October,
William B. Taylor Jr.
, the
chargé d'affaires for Ukraine
, testified before congressional committees that soon after arriving in Ukraine in June 2019, he found that Zelenskyy was being subjected to pressure directed by Trump and led by Giuliani. According to Taylor and others, the goal was to coerce Zelenskyy into making a public commitment investigating the company that employed Hunter Biden, as well as rumors about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
[596]
He said it was made clear that until Zelenskyy made such an announcement, the administration would not release scheduled military aid for Ukraine and not invite Zelenskyy to the White House.
[597]
On December 13, the
House Judiciary Committee
voted along party lines to pass two articles of impeachment: one for
abuse of power
and one for
obstruction of Congress
.
[598]
After debate, the House of Representatives
impeached
Trump on both articles on December 18.
[599]
Impeachment trial in the Senate
Main article:
First impeachment trial of Donald Trump
During the trial in January 2020, the House impeachment managers presented their case for three days. They cited evidence to support charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and asserted that Trump's actions were exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when they created the Constitution's impeachment process.
[600]
Trump displaying the headline "Trump acquitted"
Responding over the next three days, Trump's lawyers did not deny the facts as presented in the charges but said Trump had not broken any laws or obstructed Congress.
[601]
They argued that the impeachment was "constitutionally and legally invalid" because Trump was not charged with a crime and that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense.
[601]
On January 31, the Senate voted against allowing subpoenas for witnesses or documents; 51 Republicans formed the majority for this vote.
[602]
The impeachment trial was the first in U.S. history without witness testimony.
[603]
Trump was acquitted of both charges by the Republican majority, 52-48 on abuse of power and 53-47 on obstruction of Congress. Senator
Mitt Romney
was the only Republican who voted to convict Trump on one charge, the abuse of power.
[604]
Following his acquittal, Trump fired impeachment witnesses and other political appointees and career officials he deemed insufficiently loyal.

Breaking with precedent, Trump filed to run for a second term with the FEC within a few hours of assuming the presidency.
[606]
He held his first re-election rally less than a month after taking office
[607]
and officially became the
Republican nominee
in August 2020.
[608]
In his first two years in office, Trump's reelection committee reported raising $67.5 million and began 2019 with $19.3 million in cash.
[609]
By July 2020, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party had raised $1.1 billion and spent $800 million, losing their cash advantage over Biden.
[610]
The cash shortage forced the campaign to scale back advertising spending.
[611]
Trump campaign advertisements focused on crime, claiming that cities would descend into lawlessness if Biden won the presidency.
[612]
Trump repeatedly misrepresented Biden's positions
[613]
[614]
and shifted to appeals to racism.
[615]
2020 presidential election

2020 United States presidential election
See also:
2020 United States Postal Service crisis
Starting in spring 2020, Trump began to sow doubts about the election, claiming without evidence that the election would be rigged and that the expected widespread use of mail balloting would produce massive election fraud.
[616]
[617]
In July, Trump raised the idea of delaying the election.
[618]
When, in August, the House of Representatives voted for a $25 billion grant to the U.S. Postal Service for the expected surge in mail voting, Trump blocked funding, saying he wanted to prevent any increase in voting by mail.
[619]
He repeatedly refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and commit to a
peaceful transition of power
if he lost.
[620]
[621]
Biden won the election on November 3, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3 percent) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.8 percent)
[622]
[623]
and 306

2020 Electoral College results; Trump lost 232-306.
At 2 a.m. the morning after the election, with the results still unclear, Trump declared victory.
[625]
After Biden was projected the winner days later, Trump stated that "this election is far from over" and baselessly alleged election fraud.
[626]
Trump and his allies filed many
legal challenges to the results
, which were rejected by at least 86 judges in both the
state
and
federal courts
, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself, finding no factual or legal basis.
[627]
[628]
Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.
[629]
After
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) director
Chris Krebs
contradicted Trump's fraud allegations, Trump dismissed him on November 17.
[630]
On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear
a case from the Texas attorney general
that asked the court to overturn the election results in four states won by Biden.
[631]
Trump withdrew from public activities in the weeks following the election.
[632]
He initially blocked government officials from cooperating in
Biden's presidential transition
.
[633]
[634]
After three weeks, the administrator of the
General Services Administration
declared Biden the "apparent winner" of the election, allowing the disbursement of transition resources to his team.
[635]
Trump still did not formally concede while claiming he recommended the GSA begin transition protocols.
[636]
[637]
The Electoral College formalized Biden's victory on December 14.
[624]
From November to January, Trump repeatedly sought help to
overturn the results of the election
, personally pressuring various Republican local and state office-holders,
[638]
Republican state and federal legislators,
[639]
the Justice Department,
[640]
and Vice President Pence,
[641]
urging various actions such as
replacing presidential electors
, or a request for Georgia officials to "find" votes and announce a "recalculated" result.
[639]
On February 10, 2021, Georgia prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Trump's efforts to subvert the election in Georgia.
[642]
Trump did not attend Biden's inauguration, leaving Washington for Florida hours before.
[643]
Concern about a possible coup attempt or military action
In December 2020,
Newsweek
reported
the Pentagon
was on red alert, and ranking officers had discussed what they would do if Trump decided to declare
martial law
. The Pentagon responded with quotes from defense leaders that the military has no role to play in the outcome of elections.
[644]
When Trump moved supporters into positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Mark Milley
and CIA director
Gina Haspel
became concerned about the threat of a possible
coup
attempt or military action against China or Iran.
[645]
[646]
Milley insisted that he should be consulted about any military orders from Trump, including the use of nuclear weapons, and he instructed Haspel and NSA director
Paul Nakasone
to monitor developments closely.

Timeline of the January 6 United States Capitol attack
On January 6, 2021, while
congressional certification of the presidential election results
was taking place in the United States Capitol, Trump held a noon rally at
the Ellipse
,
Washington, D.C.
. He called for the election result to be overturned and urged his supporters to "take back our country" by marching to the Capitol to "show strength" and "fight like hell".
[649]
[650]
Many supporters did, joining a crowd already there. Around 2:15
p.m. the mob broke into the building, disrupting certification and causing the evacuation of Congress.
[651]
During the violence, Trump watched TV and posted messages on Twitter without asking the rioters to disperse. At 6
p.m., Trump tweeted that the rioters should "go home with love & in peace", calling them "great patriots" and "very special" and repeating that the election was stolen from him.
[652]
After the mob was removed from the Capitol, Congress reconvened and confirmed the Biden election win in the early hours of the following morning.
[653]
According to the Department of Justice, more than 140 police officers were injured, and five people died.
[654]
[655]
In March 2023, Trump collaborated with incarcerated rioters on a
song to benefit the prisoners
, and, in June, he said that, if elected, he would pardon a large number of them.

Second impeachment

signing the second impeachment of Trump
On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with
incitement of insurrection
against the U.S. government was introduced to the House.
[657]
The House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump on January 13, making him the first U.S. president to be impeached twice.
[658]
Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment—the most members of a party ever to vote to impeach a president of their own party.
[659]
On February 13, following a
five-day Senate trial
, Trump was acquitted when the Senate voted 57-43 for conviction, falling ten votes short of the two-thirds majority required to convict; seven Republicans joined every Democrat in voting to convict, the most bipartisan support in any Senate impeachment trial of a president or former president.
[660]
[661]
Most Republicans voted to acquit Trump, although some held him responsible but felt the Senate did not have jurisdiction over former presidents (Trump had left office on January 20; the Senate voted 56-44 the trial was constitutional);
[662]
included in the latter group was
Mitch McConnell
.

Legal affairs of Donald Trump
At the end of his term, Trump went to live at his Mar-a-Lago club.

As provided for by the
Former Presidents Act
,
[665]
he established an office there to handle his post-presidential activities.
[665]
[666]
Trump's false claims
concerning the 2020 election were commonly referred to as the "
big lie
" in the press and by his critics. In May 2021, Trump and his supporters attempted to co-opt the term, using it to refer to the election itself.
[667]
[668]
The Republican Party used Trump's false election narrative to justify the
imposition of new voting restrictions
in its favor.
[668]
[669]
As late as July 2022, Trump was still pressuring state legislators to overturn the 2020 election by rescinding the state's electoral votes for Biden.
[670]
Trump resumed his campaign-style rallies with an 85-minute speech at the annual
North Carolina Republican Party
convention on June 6, 2021.
[671]
[672]
On June 26, he held his first public rally since the January 6 rally that preceded the
riot at the Capitol
.
[673]
Unlike other former presidents, Trump continued to dominate his party; he has been compared to a modern-day
party boss
. He continued fundraising, raising more than twice as much as the Republican Party itself, hinted at a third candidacy, and profited from fundraisers many Republican candidates held at Mar-a-Lago. Much of his focus was on the people in charge of elections and how elections are run. In the
2022 midterm elections
he endorsed over 200 candidates for various offices, most of whom supported his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.
[674]
[675]
[676]
A majority of candidates endorsed by him won in Republican primary elections.
[675]
Trump registered a new company in February 2021.
Trump Media & Technology Group
(TMTG) was formed for providing "social networking services" to "customers in the United States".
[677]
[678]
In October 2021, Trump announced the planned merger of TMTG with Digital World Acquisition,
[679]
a
special-purpose acquisition company
(SPAC). A main backer of the SPAC is China-based financier ARC Group, who was reportedly involved in setting up the proposed merger. The transaction is under investigation by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
.
[680]
[681]
In February 2022, TMTG launched
Truth Social
, a
Twitter
-like social-media platform.
[682]
As of March 2023, Trump Media, which had taken $8 million from Russia-connected entities, was being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible money laundering.
[683]
[684]
Investigations, criminal charges, civil lawsuits
Trump is the subject of numerous probes into his actions and business dealings before, during and after his presidency.
[685]
In February 2021, the district attorney for
Fulton County, Georgia
,
Fani Willis
, announced a criminal probe into
Trump's phone calls
to Georgia Secretary of State
Brad Raffensperger
.
[686]
The
New York State Attorney General's Office
is conducting criminal investigations into Trump's business activities in conjunction with the
Manhattan District Attorney's Office
.
[687]
By May 2021, a special
grand jury
was considering indictments.
[688]
[689]
In July 2021, New York prosecutors charged the Trump Organization with a "15 year 'scheme to defraud' the government".
[690]
In January 2023, the organization's chief financial officer,
Allen Weisselberg
, was sentenced to five months in jail and five years probation for tax fraud after a plea deal.

Classified intelligence material found during search of Mar-a-Lago
When Trump left the White House in January 2021, he took government documents and material with him to Mar-a-Lago. By May 2021, the
National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA), the federal agency that preserves government records, realized that important documents had not been turned over to them at the end of Trump's term and asked his office to locate them. In January 2022, they retrieved 15 boxes of White House records from Mar-a-Lago. NARA later informed the Department of Justice that some of the retrieved documents were classified material.
[692]
The Justice Department began an investigation in April 2022 and convened a grand jury.
[693]
The Justice Department sent Trump a subpoena for additional material on May 11.
[692]
On June 3, Justice Department officials visited Mar-a-Lago and received some classified documents from Trump's lawyers.
[692]
One of the lawyers signed a statement affirming that all material marked as classified had been returned to the government.
[694]
Later that month an additional subpoena was sent requesting surveillance footage from Mar-a-Lago, which was provided.
[692]
[695]
[696]
On August 8, 2022, FBI agents searched Trump's residence, office, and storage areas at Mar-a-Lago to recover government documents and material Trump had taken with him when he left office in violation of the
Presidential Records Act
,
[697]
[698]
reportedly including some related to nuclear weapons.
[696]
The search warrant, authorized by U.S. Attorney General
Merrick Garland
and approved by a federal magistrate judge, and the written inventory of the seized items were made public on August 12. The text of the search warrant indicates an investigation of potential violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice laws.
[699]
The items taken in the search included 11 sets of classified documents, four of them tagged as "top secret" and one as "top secret/SCI", the highest level of classification.
[697]
[698]
On November 18, 2022, Garland appointed a special counsel, federal prosecutor
Jack Smith
, to oversee the federal criminal investigations into Trump retaining government property at Mar-a-Lago and
examining Trump's role in the events leading up to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack

In September 2022, the New York State Attorney General filed a civil fraud case against Trump, his three oldest children, and the Trump Organization.
[719]
In December 2021, the Attorney General's office had subpoenaed Trump to produce documents related to his business.
[720]
In April 2022, a New York state judge held Trump in contempt of court for failing to comply with the subpoena and imposed a fine of $10,000 per day until he does.
[721]
Trump was deposed in August and invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination
more than 400 times.

ranked Trump fourth-lowest overall in their
Presidential Historians Survey 2021
, with Trump rated lowest in the leadership characteristics categories for moral authority and administrative skills.

[732]
[733]
The
Siena College Research Institute
(SCRI) has surveyed presidential scholars during the second year of the first term of each president since 1982. In their 2022 survey,
SCRI ranked Trump
43rd out of 45 presidents. He was ranked last on background, integrity, intelligence, foreign policy accomplishments, and executive appointments, and second to last on ability to compromise, executive ability, and present overall view. He was ranked near the bottom in all categories except for luck, willingness to take risks, and party leadership.

Further information:
Opinion polling on the Donald Trump administration
and
Historical rankings of presidents of the United States
Trump was the only president to never reach a 50 percent approval rating in the Gallup poll dating to 1938. His approval ratings showed a record-high partisan gap: 88 percent among Republicans and 7 percent among Democrats.
[734]
Until September 2020, the ratings were unusually stable, reaching a high of 49 percent and a low of 35 percent.
[735]
Trump finished his term with an approval rating between 29 percent and 34 percent—the lowest of any president since modern
polling
began—and a record-low average of 41 percent throughout his presidency.
[734]
[736]
In
Gallup's annual poll
asking Americans to name the man they admire the most, Trump placed second to Obama in 2017 and 2018, tied with Obama for most admired man in 2019, and was named most admired in 2020.
[737]
[738]
Since
Gallup
started conducting the poll in 1948, Trump is the first elected president not to be named most admired in his first year in office.
[739]
A Gallup poll in 134 countries comparing the approval ratings of U.S. leadership between the years 2016 and 2017 found that Trump led Obama in job approval in only 29 countries, most of them non-democracies;
[740]
approval of U.S. leadership plummeted among allies and G7 countries. Overall ratings were similar to those in the last two years of the
George W. Bush presidency
.
[741]
By mid-2020, only 16 percent of international respondents to a 13-nation
Pew Research
poll expressed confidence in Trump, a lower score than those accorded to Russia's
Vladimir Putin
and China's
Xi Jinping
.

Fact-checkers
from
The Washington Post
,
[743]
the
Toronto Star
,
[744]
and CNN
[745]
compiled data on "false or misleading claims" (orange background), and "false claims" (violet foreground), respectively.
As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks
[163]
[159]
to an extent unprecedented in
American politics
.
[746]
[747]
His falsehoods became a distinctive part of his political identity.
[746]
Trump's false and misleading statements were documented by
fact-checkers
, including at
The Washington Post
, which tallied a total of 30,573 false or misleading statements made by Trump over his four-year term.
[743]
Trump's falsehoods increased in frequency over time, rising from about six false or misleading claims per day in his first year as president to 16 per day in his second year, 22 per day in his third year, and 39 per day in his final year.
[748]
Some of Trump's falsehoods were inconsequential, such as his claim of the "biggest inaugural crowd ever".
[749]
[750]
Others had more far-reaching effects, such as his promotion of unproven antimalarial drugs as a treatment for COVID-19 in a press conference and on Twitter.
[751]
[752]
The claims had consequences worldwide, such as a shortage of these drugs in the United States and
panic-buying
in Africa and South Asia.
[753]
[754]
Other misinformation, such as misattributing a rise in crime in
England and Wales
to the "spread of radical Islamic terror", served Trump's domestic political purposes.
[755]
As a matter of principle, Trump does not apologize for his falsehoods.
[756]
Despite the frequency of Trump's falsehoods, the media rarely referred to them as lies.
[757]

did so was in August 2018, when it declared that some of Trump's misstatements, in particular those concerning hush money paid to Stormy Daniels and
Playboy
model Karen McDougal, were lies.
[759]
[758]
In 2020, Trump was a significant source of disinformation on mail-in voting and misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic.
[760]
[761]
His attacks on mail-in ballots and other election practices served to weaken public faith in the integrity of the 2020 presidential election,
[762]
[763]
while his disinformation about the pandemic delayed and weakened the national response to it.
[455]
[760]
James Pfiffner, professor of policy and government at George Mason University, wrote in 2019 that Trump lies differently from previous presidents, because he offers "egregious false statements that are demonstrably contrary to well-known facts"; these lies are the "most important" of all Trump lies. By calling facts into question, people will be unable to properly evaluate their government, with beliefs or policy irrationally settled by "political power"; this erodes
liberal democracy
, wrote Pfiffner.
[764]
Promotion of conspiracy theories
Main article:
List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump
Before and throughout his presidency, Trump has promoted numerous conspiracy theories, including
Obama birtherism
, the
Clinton body count conspiracy theory
, the conspiracy theory movement
QAnon
, the
Global warming hoax
theory,
Trump Tower wiretapping allegations
, a
John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory
involving
Rafael Cruz
, linking talk show host
Joe Scarborough
to the death of a staffer,
[765]
alleged foul-play in the death of Justice
Antonin Scalia
,
alleged Ukrainian interference in U.S. elections
, and that
Osama bin Laden was alive
and Obama and Biden had members of
Navy SEAL Team 6
killed.
[766]
[767]
[768]
[769]
[770]
In at least two instances, Trump clarified to press that he also believed the conspiracy theory in question.
[768]
During and since the 2020 presidential election, Trump has promoted various conspiracy theories for his defeat including dead people voting,
[771]
voting machines changing or deleting Trump votes, fraudulent mail-in voting, throwing out Trump votes, and "finding" suitcases full of Biden votes.
[772]
[773]
Incitement of violence
Research suggests Trump's rhetoric caused an increased incidence of hate crimes.
[774]
[775]
During his 2016 campaign, he urged or praised physical attacks against protesters or reporters.
[776]
[777]
Numerous defendants investigated or prosecuted for violent acts and hate crimes, including participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, cited Trump's rhetoric in arguing that they were not culpable or should receive a lighter sentence.
[778]
[779]
A nationwide review by ABC News in May 2020 identified at least 54 criminal cases from August 2015 to April 2020 in which Trump was invoked in direct connection with violence or threats of violence mostly by white men and primarily against members of minority groups.
[780]
Social media
Main article:
Social media use by Donald Trump
Trump's social media presence attracted worldwide attention after he joined
Twitter
in 2009. He tweeted frequently during the 2016 election campaign and as president until Twitter banned him in the final days of his term.
[781]
Trump often used Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public and sidelining of the press.
[782]
In June 2017, a White House press secretary said that Trump's tweets were official presidential statements.
[783]
Trump often announced terminations of administration officials over Twitter.
[784]
After years of criticism for allowing Trump to post misinformation and falsehoods, Twitter began to tag some of his tweets with fact-checking warnings in May 2020.
[785]
In response, Trump tweeted that "Social Media Platforms totally silence conservative[] voices" and that he would "strongly regulate[] or close them down".
[786]
In the days after the storming of the United States Capitol, Trump was banned from
Facebook
,
Instagram
, Twitter and other platforms.
[787]
The loss of Trump's social media presence diminished his ability to shape events
[788]
[789]
and prompted a dramatic decrease in the volume of misinformation shared on Twitter.
[790]
Trump's early attempts to re-establish a social media presence were unsuccessful.
[791]
In February 2022, he launched social media platform
Truth Social
where he only attracted a fraction of his Twitter following.
[792]
Elon Musk
, the new owner of Twitter, reinstated Trump's Twitter account in November 2022.
[793]
Relationship with the press
Further information:
Presidency of Donald Trump § Relationship with the news media
Trump talking to the press, March 2017
Trump sought media attention throughout his career, sustaining a "love-hate" relationship with the press.
[794]
In the 2016 campaign, Trump benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.
[156]
The New York Times
writer
Amy Chozick
wrote in 2018 that Trump's media dominance enthralled the public and created "must-see TV."
[795]
As a candidate and as president, Trump frequently accused the press of bias, calling it the "fake news media" and "the
enemy of the people
".
[796]
In 2018, journalist
Lesley Stahl
recounted Trump's saying he intentionally demeaned and discredited the media "so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you".
[797]
As president, Trump privately and publicly mused about revoking the press credentials of journalists he viewed as critical.
[798]
His administration moved to revoke the press passes of two White House reporters, which were restored by the courts.
[799]
In 2019, a member of the foreign press reported many of the same concerns as those of media in the U.S., expressing concern that a normalization process by reporters and media results in an inaccurate characterization of Trump.
[800]
The Trump White House held about a hundred formal press briefings in 2017, declining by half during 2018 and to two in 2019.
[799]
Trump also deployed the legal system to intimidate the press.
[801]
In early 2020, the Trump campaign sued
The New York Times
,
The Washington Post
, and CNN for defamation in opinion pieces about Russian election interference.
[802]
[803]
Legal experts said that the lawsuits lacked merit and were not likely to succeed.
[801]
[804]
By March 2021, the lawsuits against
The New York Times
and CNN had been dismissed.
[805]
[806]
Racial views
Main article:
Racial views of Donald Trump
Many of Trump's comments and actions have been considered racist.
[807]
[808]
In national polling, about half of respondents said that Trump is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.
[809]
[810]
Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled Trump's political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.
[811]
[812]
Racist and
Islamophobic
attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.
[813]
In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged
housing discrimination
against black renters.
[49]
He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989
Central Park jogger case
, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. As of 2019, he maintained this position.
[814]
In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, he became the leading proponent of the racist
"birther" conspiracy theory
, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States.
[815]
[816]
In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the "long-form" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him "very popular".
[817]
[818]
In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.
[819]
In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views in private.
[820]
According to an analysis in
Political Science Quarterly
, Trump made "explicitly racist appeals to whites" during his 2016 presidential campaign.
[821]
In particular, his campaign launch speech drew widespread criticism for claiming Mexican immigrants were "bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists".
[822]
[823]
His later comments about a Mexican-American judge presiding over a civil suit regarding
Trump University
were also criticized as racist.
[824]
Trump answers questions from reporters about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.
Trump's comments on the
2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia
, condemning "this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides" and stating that there were "very fine people on both sides", were widely criticized as implying a
moral equivalence
between the white supremacist demonstrators and the counter-protesters.
[825]
[826]
[827]
[828]
In a January 2018
Oval Office
meeting to discuss immigration legislation, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African nations as "shithole countries".
[829]
His remarks were condemned as racist.
[830]
[831]
In July 2019, Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen—all from minorities, three of whom are native-born Americans—should "
go back
" to the countries they "came from".
[832]
Two days later the House of Representatives voted 240-187, mostly along party lines, to condemn his "racist comments".
[833]
White nationalist
publications and social media sites praised his remarks, which continued over the following days.
[834]
Trump continued to make similar remarks during his 2020 campaign.
[835]
Misogyny and allegations of sexual misconduct
Main article:
Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations
Trump has a history of insulting and belittling women when speaking to media and on social media.
[836]
[837]
He made lewd comments, demeaned women's looks, and called them names, such as "dog", "crazed", "crying lowlife", "face of a pig", or "horseface".
[837]
[838]
[839]
At least 26 women publicly accused Trump of rape, kissing, and groping without consent; looking under women's skirts; and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants.
[840]
[841]
[842]
Trump has denied all of the allegations.
[842]
In October 2016, two days before the
second presidential debate
, a 2005 "
hot mic
" recording surfaced in which
Trump was heard bragging
about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that "when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the
pussy
."
[843]
The incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during the campaign
[844]
and caused outrage across the political spectrum.
[845]

Musicians who oppose Donald Trump's use of their music
Trump has been the subject of parody, comedy, and caricature on television, in films, and in comics. He has been named in hundreds of
hip hop
songs since the 1980s—until 2015, most of these references cast Trump in a positive light, but they turned largely negative after he began running for office.

Rubens painting,
Bathsheba at the Fountain
, damaged in the fighting
Kunstlump
refers to a debate in
Germany
in 1920 which arose after
Oscar Kokoschka
complained that violent confrontation which arose during the
Kapp Putsch
had damaged a painting in the
Semper Gallery
located in the
Zwinger
. He argued that the value a painting by
Peter Paul Rubens
was of greater importance than the lives of people killed in the confrontation and suggested that
field of combat
should be relocated to heathland. This elicited a sharp response from
George Grosz
and
John Heartfield
.
Kokoschka's original appeal had appeared in over forty newspapers following  the events of 15 March 1920 in
Postplatz
, Dresden. In clashes between striking workers and soldiers involved in the Kapp Putsch, 59 people died with 150 wounded. However one bullet entered the gallery and damaged
Bathsheba at the Fountain
, which Rubens had painted in 1635. Kokoschka had been appointed professor at the
Dresden Academy of Fine Arts
in 1919.

[2]
History
[
edit

In 2003,
Aylesbury Vale District Council
held a public consultation into plans for a new theatre to be built to replace the current Civic Centre Theatre. Norman Bragg for
London
based
architects
Aedas
RHWL
Arts Team was commissioned in 2007 to undertake detailed design work
[3]
with a ceremony to mark the commencement of building work held on 24 May of that year with Councillor Sue Polhill, Chairman of Aylesbury Vale District Council cutting a sod from the earth.
[4]
The building work was carried out by
Hertfordshire
-based
Willmott Dixon
.
[5]
[6]
On 18 February 2009
Ambassador Theatre Group
was announced as the preferred management contractor for the new venue
[5]
with Joint Chief Executives
Howard Panter
and
Rosemary Squire
,
OBE
signing a 6-year management contract in January 2010.
[7]
Aylesbury-raised actress
Lynda Bellingham
marked the completion of the highest part of the building work on 24 April 2009 with a traditional
topping out
ceremony.
[8]
In a joint press release on 23 February 2010, Ambassador Theatre Group and Aylesbury Vale District Council announced that the theatre would open on 12 October 2010.
[9]
The first season went on sale on 23 March 2010 with
Northern Ballet
's
Swan Lake
set to be the first performance.
[10]
Acoustics
[
edit
]
The acoustic design, by Arup Acoustics, includes a CARMEN
[11]
electroacoustic enhancement system. This electronically adjusts the base acoustic (designed for speech and amplified events) to provide a more reverberant sound for symphonic and choral performances.
Grand opening
[
edit
]
Aylesbury Waterside Theatre was officially opened on 12 October 2010 by
Cilla Black
. The launch was marked with an open air live event hosted by
Jonathan Wilkes
and
Suzanne Shaw
. Guests included
David Suchet
,
Simon Callow
,
Ruby Wax
,
Susan Hampshire
and
Richard O'Brien
.
[12]
Monty Python
star and
Spamalot
writer
Eric Idle
sent a pre-recorded message to mark the occasion.
[13]
Funding and Costs
[
edit
]
At the time the theatre was given planning permission in 2006, it was expected to cost £25 million. When the contractor Willmott Dixon was appointed in 2008, the cost had risen to £35 million. By the time the theatre opened in 2010 the final cost had risen again, to £47 million.
[1]
Aylesbury Vale District Council
(AVDC) appointed Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG) to manage the theatre. AVDC paid more than £192,000 in management fees to ATG from November 2010 to May 2011 and £350,000 in the first 12 months of operation. AVDC will also pay out £1.75 million towards running the Theatre over a five-year period.
[14]
In 2010 AVDC paid the Ambassador Theatre Group £19,500 to hire Aylesbury's Waterside Theatre, which the council owns and pays its business rates, for the 2010 general election count.
[15]
Criticism of AVDC over the theatre in the local press led to AVDC councillors being banned from speaking to the local newspaper, the
Bucks Herald
, because of the way in which stories were being covered.
[16]
In April 2012, ATG reported a profits rise of 164 per cent. The ATG made £2.3 million in 2009 which rose to £16.3 million in 2011, through the 39 venues it now operates. This led to calls from some local politicians for the subsidy from AVDC of £600,000 pa. to be reduced when the contract is renegotiated in 2014.

The Agbada Formation has intervals that contain
organic-carbon

The intervals, however, rarely reach thickness sufficient to produce a world-classoil province and are immature in various parts of the delta.  The Akata shale is present in large volumes beneath the Agbada Formation  and is at least volumetrically sufficient to generate enough oil for a world class oil province such as the Niger Delta.

Harris
et al.

The
Sulawesi streaked flycatcher
(
Muscicapa sodhii
) is a small
passerine
bird in the
Old World flycatcher
family.  It has only been recorded in
Sulawesi
, where it is known to breed. It appears not to be endangered, being less sensitive to disturbance than many of Southeast Asia's forest-dependent birds.
[1]
The species was first announced in 1999 but no formal description was included in the report.
[2]
Its Latin name,
Muscicapa sodhii
, was given in honor of
Navjot Sodhi
(1962-2011), an Indian ornithologist and conservationist.
[1]
The bird is about 14 cm (5.5 in) long and has a streaked brownish-grey plumage, with a pale throat and breast. It has a distinctive white eye-ring and a blackish bill. The Sulawesi streaked flycatcher is usually found in the forest understorey and midstory, where it feeds on insects, such as flies, ants, and beetles.
The bird was first described in 2009 by a team of ornithologists from the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences. It was named after the late Mr. Sohdi, a conservationist from Sulawesi who had dedicated his life to protecting the island's wildlife.
The Sulawesi streaked flycatcher is considered to be a vulnerable species due to habitat loss caused by deforestation and conversion of forested areas to agriculture. The bird is currently protected under Indonesian law, and conservation efforts are underway to protect its habitat and ensure its survival.
The Sulawesi streaked flycatcher looks similar to the
grey-streaked flycatcher
, which lives part of the year in Sulawesi, but breeds in Northern Asia. Genetically, it is more closely related to the Thai population of
Asian brown flycatcher
M. dauurica siamensis
.
[1]
While there is not a lot of information available on the Sulawesi streaked flycatcher, there are scientific papers and reports published on the bird that provide more detailed information on its biology, behavior, and conservation status.

He was born at
Liège
, received his education at home and in Paris, and began the practice of law in his native town. He identified himself with the
Liberal party
, and was conspicuous in the controversy with the
Catholic clergy
.
Career
[
edit
]
In 1846, he wrote the program, which was accepted as the charter for a
liberal political party
. In
1847
he was elected to the Belgian Chamber and appointed Minister of Public Works. and from 1848 to 1852 he held the portfolio of Finance.  He founded the national bank of Belgium, reduced postage, abolished the newspaper tax and was a strong advocate of
free trade
.
His work,
La mainmorte et la charité
(1854-57), directed against the
Conservatives
, produced a great effect on the position of parties in Belgium. As a result, in
1857
, the Liberals returned to power and Frère-Orban became once more
minister of Finance
in the cabinet of
Charles Rogier
, whom he succeeded to become the
prime minister
in 1868. In
1870
the Catholics regained their supremacy and forced him to retire, but from
1878
to 1884 he was again at the head of the cabinet, most notably breaking off diplomatic relations with the
Papal States
in 1880 (which were restored in 1884).
Standing as a liberal again in the
October 1894 elections
, he categorically refused the support of Catholics against progressives and socialists. He was not re-elected, defeated by the socialist
Célestin Demblon
.
Weakened by illness, he died on 2 January 1896. Frère-Orban lies in its birthplace, Liège, in the cemetery of Robermont.
Political philosophy
[
edit
]
Frère-Orban's liberalism consisted in the assertion of the authority of the state over the church and the defense of the system of secular public instruction against the clergy. He was at all times opposed to the "undue extension" of
suffrage
. Among other works he wrote
La question monétaire
.

[9]
At Oberlin, she wrote for a conservative student newspaper started by Jesse Malkin, who later became her husband.

Her first article for the paper heavily criticized Oberlin's
affirmative action
program, and she said it received a "huge[ly] negative response" from other students on campus.

She graduated in 1992 and later described her alma mater as "radically left-wing".
[11]
[12]

Seattle
,
Washington
, where she became a columnist for

radical right
".

Since 1999, Malkin has written a
syndicated
column for
Creators Syndicate
.
[14]
Her column is published by outlets including

[37]
Some conservative scholars spoke out in support of the book, including

Jamil Hussein
Main article:
Jamil Hussein controversy
In late 2006 and early 2007, Malkin was a leading voice among several right-wing bloggers who questioned both the credibility and the existence of Iraqi police captain Jamil Hussein, who had been used as a source by the
Associated Press
in over 60 stories about the Iraq war.
[54]
[55]
[56]
The controversy began in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. The
Iraqi Ministry of the Interior
and the United States military initially denied Hussein existed, leading Malkin and others to dispute the AP's reporting.
In January 2007 the AP reported that the Ministry had acknowledged Hussein's existence, and that authorities were seeking his arrest for having spoken to the press.
[55]
[56]
[57]
Malkin reported the Iraqi government's confirmation. According to
The Washington Post
, Malkin also "expressed regret", though media scholar Arthur S. Hayes wrote in his 2008 book
Press Critics are the Fifth Estate
that her post "contains no apology or words of regret from her".

[79]
In 2017, Malkin endorsed alt-right candidate

Gavin McInnes
for a
Facebook Live
event to promote her book, and agreed with him when he claimed that Soros was "not a Holocaust survivor" but a "Holocaust facilitator": Malkin has denied accusations of anti-semitism, saying that she is "the proud wife of a grandson of Ukrainian Jews who came to this country to escape pogroms [and is] a proud supporter of Israel, but more importantly, a proud supporter of American sovereignty."
[88]
At the 2020 America First Political Action Conference, Malkin said it was "not anti-semitic" to question "whatever the precise number of people is who perished in World War II."

Haplogroup I
(
M170
) is a
Y-chromosome DNA
haplogroup. It is a subgroup of
haplogroup IJ
, which itself is a derivative of the
haplogroup IJK
. Subclades
I1
and
I2
can be found in most present-day European populations, with peaks in some
Northern European
and
Southeastern European
countries.
Haplogroup I appears to have arisen in Europe, so far being found in Palaeolithic sites throughout Europe (Fu 2016), but not outside it. It diverged from common ancestor IJ* about 43,000 years B.P. (Karafet 2008). Early evidence for haplogroup J has been found in the Caucasus and Iran (Jones 2015, Fu 2016). In addition, living examples of the precursor Haplogroup IJ* have been found only in Iran, among the
Mazandarani
and ethnic
Persians
from
Fars
.
[1]
This may indicate that IJ originated in
South West Asia
.
Haplogroup I has been found in multiple individuals belonging to the Gravettian culture. The
Gravettians
expanded westwards from the far corner of Eastern Europe, likely Russia, to Central Europe. They are associated with a genetic cluster that is normally called the Věstonice cluster.

Available evidence suggests that I-M170 was preceded into areas in which it would later become dominant by haplogroups
K2a
(K-M2308) and
C1
(Haplogroup C-F3393). K2a and C1 have been found in the oldest sequenced male remains from Western Eurasia (dating from circa 45,000 to 35,000 years
BP
), such as:
Ust'-Ishim man
(modern west Siberia) K2a*,
Oase 1
(Romania) K2a*,
Kostenki 14
(south west Russia) C1b, and
Goyet Q116-1
(Belgium) C1a.
[5]
[6]
The oldest I-M170 found is that of an individual known as
Krems
WA3 (lower Austria), dating from circa 33,000-24,000 BP. At the same site, two twin boys were also found, both were assigned to haplogroup I*.
[7]
[8]
Haplogroup IJ was in the
Middle East
and/or
Europe
about 40,000 years ago.

The TMRCA (time to
most recent common ancestor
) for I-M170 was estimated by Karafet and colleagues in 2008 to be 22,200 years ago, with a confidence interval between 15,300 and 30,000 years ago.
[9]
This would make the founding event of I-M170 approximately contemporaneous with the
Last Glacial Maximum
(LGM), which lasted from 26,500 years ago until approximately 19,500 years ago.
[10]
TMRCA is an estimate of the time of subclade divergence. Rootsi and colleagues in 2004 also note two other dates for a clade, age of STR variation, and time since population divergence. These last two dates are roughly associated, and occur somewhat after subclade divergence. For Haplogroup I-M170 they estimate time to STR variation as 24,000 ±7,100 years ago and time to population divergence as 23,000 ±7,700 years ago.
[11]
These estimates are consistent with those of Karafet 2008 cited above. However, Underhill and his colleagues calculate the time to subclade divergence of I1 and I2 to be 28,400 ±5,100 years ago, although they calculate the STR variation age of I1 at only 8,100 ±1,500 years ago.
[12]
Semino (2000) speculated that the initial dispersion of this population corresponds to the diffusion of the
Gravettian
culture.
[13]
Later the haplogroup, along with two cases of
Haplogroup C
, was found in human remains belonging to the previously mentioned Gravettian culture and in individuals of the
Magdalenian
and
Azilian
cultures.
[14]
Rootsi and colleagues in 2004 suggested that each of the ancestral populations now dominated by a particular subclade of Haplogroup I-M170 experienced an independent population expansion immediately after the Last Glacial Maximum.
[11]
The five known cases of Haplogroup I from
Upper Paleolithic
European human remains make it one of the most frequent haplogroup from that period.
[14]
In 2016, the 31,210-34,580-year-old remains of a hunter-gatherer from
Paglicci Cave
, Apulia, Italy were found to carry I-M170.
[15]
So far, only
Haplogroup F*
and
Haplogroup C
1b have been documented, once each, on older remains in Europe. I2 subclade of I-M170 is the main haplogroup found on male remains in
Mesolithic
Europe, until circa 6,000 BCE, when
mass migration
into Europe of Anatolian farmers carrying Y-DNA G2a happened.
[16]
Due to the arrival of so-called
Early European Farmers
(EEFs), I-M170 is outnumbered by
Haplogroup G
among
Neolithic
European remains and by
Haplogroup R
in later remains.
The earliest documentation of
I1
is from Neolithic Hungary, although it must have separated from I2 at an earlier point in time.
In one instance, haplogroup I was found far from Europe, among 2,000-year-old remains from Mongolia.
[17]
It would seem to be that separate waves of population movement impacted
Southeastern Europe
. The role of the
Balkans
as a long-standing corridor to Europe from
Anatolia
and/or the
Caucasus
is shown by the common phylogenetic origins of both haplogroups I and J in the parent haplogroup IJ (M429). This common ancestry suggests that the subclades of IJ entered the Balkans from Anatolia or the Caucasus, some time before the Last Glacial Maximum. I and J were subsequently distributed in Asia and Europe in a disjunctive phylogeographic pattern typical of "sibling" haplogroups. A natural geographical corridor like the Balkans is likely to have been used later by members of other subclades of IJ, as well as other haplogroups, including those associated with Early European Farmers.
The existence of
Haplogroup IJK
- the ancestor of both haplogroups IJ and
K
(M9) - and its evolutionary distance from other subclades of
Haplogroup F
(M89), supports the inference that haplogroups IJ and K both arose in Southwestern Asia. Living carriers of F* and IJ* have been reported from the
Iranian Plateau
.

I-M170
[
edit
]
The composite
subclade I-M170
contains individuals directly descended from the earliest members of Haplogroup I, bearing none of the subsequent mutations which identify the remaining named subclades.
Several I* individuals, who do not fall into any known subclades, have been found among the
Lak people
of
Dagestan
, at a rate of (3/21),
[85]
as well as Turkey (8/741),
Adygea
in the Caucasus (2/138) and
Iraq
(1/176), even though I-M170 occurs at only very low frequencies among modern populations of these regions as a whole. This is consistent with the belief that the haplogroup first appeared in South West Eurasia.
There are also high frequencies of Haplogroup I* among the
Andalusians
(3/103),
French
(4/179),
Slovenians
(2/55),
Tabassarans
(1/30),
[85]
and
Saami
(1/35).
[86]
(Neither study from which the above figures were drawn excluded the present I2-M438 clade as a whole, but only certain subclades, so these presumed cases I* may possibly belong to I2.)
A living
Hazara
male from Afghanistan has also been found to carry I*, with all known subclades of both I1 (M253) and I2 (M438) ruled out.
[87]
I1-M253
[
edit
]
Main article:
Haplogroup I-M253
Haplogroup I1-M253
(M253, M307, P30, P40) displays a very clear frequency gradient, with a peak frequency of approximately 35% among the populations of southern Norway, southwestern Sweden, and Denmark, and rapidly decreasing frequencies toward the edges of the historically
Germanic
-influenced world. A notable exception is Finland, where frequency in West Finns is up to 40%, and in certain provinces like
Satakunta
more than 50%. I1 is believed to have become common as a result of a founder effect during the
Nordic Bronze Age
, and subsequently spread throughout Europe during the
Migration Period
when Germanic tribes migrated from southern
Scandinavia
and northern
Germany
to other places in Europe.
[88]
Outside
Fennoscandia
, distribution of Haplogroup I1-M253 is closely correlated with that of Haplogroup I2a2-M436; but among Scandinavians (including both Germanic and Uralic peoples of the region) nearly all the Haplogroup I-M170 Y-chromosomes are I1-M253.  Another characteristic of the Scandinavian I1-M253 Y-chromosomes is their rather low
haplotype
diversity (STR diversity): a greater variety of Haplogroup I1-M253 Y-chromosomes has been found among the
French
and
Italians
, despite the much lower overall frequency of Haplogroup I1-M253 among the modern French and Italian populations. This, along with the structure of the phylogenetic tree of I1-M253 strongly suggests that most living I1 males are the descendants of an initially small group of reproductively successful men who lived in Scandinavia during the Nordic Bronze Age.
[89]
[90]
I2-M438
[
edit
]
Main article:
Haplogroup I-M438
Haplogroup I2-M438
, previously
I1b
, may have originated in southern Europe - it is now found at its highest frequencies in the western
Balkans
and
Sardinia
- some 15,000-17,000 years ago and developed into three main subgroups : I2-M438*, I2a-L460, I2b-L415 and I2c-L596.
I2a1a-M26
[
edit
]
Haplogroup I2a1a-M26
is notable for its strong presence in Sardinia. Haplogroup I-M170 comprises approximately 40% of all patrilines among the
Sardinians
, and I2a1a-M26 is the predominant type of I among them.
Haplogroup I2a1a-M26 is practically absent east of France and Italy,
[91]
while it is found at low but significant frequencies outside of Sardinia in the
Balearic Islands
,
Castile-León
, the
Basque Country
, the
Pyrenees
, southern and western France, and parts of the
Maghreb
in North Africa, Great Britain, and Ireland. Haplogroup I2a1a-M26 appears to be the only subclade of Haplogroup I-M170 found among the
Basques
, but appears to be found at somewhat higher frequencies among the general populations of
Castile-León
in Spain and
Béarn
in France than among the population of ethnic Basques.
[

]
The M26 mutation is found in native males inhabiting every geographic region where megaliths may be found, including such far-flung and culturally disconnected regions as the Canary Islands, the Balearic Isles, Corsica, Ireland, and Sweden.
[91]
The distribution of I2a1a-M26 also mirrors that of the
Atlantic Bronze Age
cultures, which indicates a potential spread via the
obsidian
trade or a regular maritime exchange of some of metallurgical products.
[91]
I2a1b-M423
[
edit
]
The approximate frequency and variance distribution of haplogroup I-P37 clusters, ancestral "Dnieper-Carpathian" (DYS448=20) and derived "Balkan" (DYS448=19: represented by a single SNP I-PH908), in Eastern Europe per O.M. Utevska (2017).
Haplogroup I2a1b-M423
is the most frequent Y-chromosome haplogroup I-M170 in Central and Eastern European populations, reaching its peak in the
Western Balkans
, most notably in
Dalmatia
(50-60%
[30]
) and
Bosnia-Herzegovina
(up to 71%,
[92]
avg. 40-50%
[30]
). Its subclade I-L161 has greater variance in Ireland and Great Britain, but overall frequency is very low (2-3%), while subclade I-L162 has the highest variance and also high concentration in Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Southeastern Poland, Belarus).
[93]
I2a2-M436
[
edit
]
The distribution of
Haplogroup I2a2-M436
(M436/P214/S33, P216/S30, P217/S23, P218/S32) is closely correlated to that of Haplogroup I1 except in
Fennoscandia
, which suggests that it was probably harbored by at least one of the Paleolithic refuge populations that also harbored Haplogroup I1-M253; the lack of correlation between the distributions of I1-M253 and I2a2-M436 in Fennoscandia may be a result of Haplogroup I2a2-M436's being more strongly affected in the earliest settlement of this region by
founder effects
and
genetic drift
due to its rarity, as Haplogroup I2a2-M436 comprises less than 10% of the total Y-chromosome diversity of all populations outside of
Lower Saxony
. Haplogroup I2a2-M436 has been found in over 4% of the population only in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, England (not including
Cornwall
),
Scotland
, and the southern tips of Sweden and Norway in Northwest Europe; the provinces of
Normandy
,
Maine
,
Anjou
, and
Perche
in northwestern France; the province of
Provence
in southeastern France; the regions of
Tuscany
,
Umbria
, and
Latium
in Italy; and
Moldavia
and the area around Russia's
Ryazan Oblast
and
Republic of Mordovia
in Eastern Europe. One subclade of Haplogroup I2a2-M436, namely I2a2a1a1-M284, has been found almost exclusively among the population of Great Britain, which has been taken to suggest that the clade may have a very long history in that island. It is notable, however, that the distributions of Haplogroup I1-M253 and Haplogroup I2a2-M436 seem to correlate fairly well with the extent of historical influence of
Germanic peoples
. The punctual presence of both haplogroups at a low frequency in the area of the historical regions of
Bithynia
and
Galatia
in Turkey may be related to the
Varangian Guard
or rather suggests a connection with the ancient
Gauls
of
Thrace
, several tribes of which are recorded to have immigrated to those parts of Anatolia at the invitation of
Nicomedes I of Bithynia
. This suggestion is supported by recent genetic studies regarding Y-DNA Haplogroup I2b2-L38 have concluded that there was some Late Iron Age migration of Celtic La Tène people, through Belgium, to the British Isles including north-east Ireland.
[94]
Haplogroup I2a2-M436 also occurs among approximately 1% of
Sardinians
, and in
Hazaras
from Afghanistan at 3%.

Height
[
edit
]
This haplogroup reaches its maximum frequency in the Western Balkans (with the highest concentration of I2 in present-day
Herzegovina
). It may be associated with unusually tall males, since those in the
Dinaric Alps
have been reported to be the tallest in the world, with an
average male height
of the range 180 cm (5 ft 11 in)-182 cm (6 ft 0 in) in the cantons of
Bosnia
, 184 cm (6 ft 0 in) in
Sarajevo
, 182 cm (6 ft 0 in)-186 cm (6 ft 1 in) in the cantons of
Herzegovina
mostly populated by
Croats
.
[96]
A 2014 study examining the correlation between Y-DNA haplogroups and height found a correlation between the
haplogroups I1
, R1b-U106, I2a1b-M423 and tall males.
[97]
The study featured the measured average heights of young German, Swedish, Dutch, Danish, Serbian and Bosnian men. The
German
male average height was 180.2 cm, the
Swedish
men were on average 181.4 cm, the
Dutch
men were 183.8 cm, the
Danish
men were 180.6 cm, the
Serbians
were 180.9 cm, and
Bosnian Croat
men from Herzegovina were 185.2 centimeters on average.

Air Outre Mer (AOM) was founded in 1988 in the French overseas département of the island of
Réunion
and began scheduled passenger service in 1990 with a
McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30
and a
Dornier 228
. In October 1991, Air Outre Mer  merged with
Air Minerve
, a French airline which was based at
Orly Airport
and had operated since 1975. The two companies began operating under the name
AOM French Airlines
although the administrative name was "
AOM-Minerve S.A.
".
Air Minerve
was the first airline to compete directly with
Air Inter
on the French domestic airline market by opening a
Paris
(
Orly
) -
Nice
route in May 1990. In February 1999,
Swissair
acquired a 49% stake in the airline as a part of its "hunter strategy".
For most of the decade, the airline fiercely competed with
Air France
on both the French domestic market and on the air routes to the French overseas territories. Due to inappropriate fleet management and  overcapacity, the airline quickly accumulated huge debts and consequently ceased operations in 2001 (possibly as a result of the bursting of the
dot-com bubble
and the
early 2000s recession
which followed)
[

]
. The airline's final bankruptcy was approved after several months of strikes.
[

]
On 25 March 2001
AOM French Airlines
merged with
Air Liberté
, the airline retaining the name "Air Liberté".
[2]
On 22 September 2001 the airline was renamed "
Air Lib
".
{Wikipedia French article}
.
[3]
AOM's disappearance was followed by several other French airlines such as
Aeris
,
Air Littoral
,
Euralair
and
Star Airlines
(later XL Airways France) in the next several years, leaving
Air France
and
Corsair International
as the two largest remaining airlines in France at the time.

On 21 December 1999,
Cubana de Aviación Flight 1216
, a
Cubana de Aviación
McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30
(
F-GTDI
) on lease from AOM on an international non-scheduled passenger flight from
Havana
(
José Martí International Airport
) suffered a landing accident at
Guatemala City
(
La Aurora Airport
),
Guatemala
. The aircraft overran runway 19 and continued down a steep slope before coming to rest in a residential area. 8 of the 296 passengers and 8 of the 18 crew as well as 2 people on the ground were killed and the aircraft was written off.
[6]
The Guatemalan
Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil
investigated the accident.
[7]
This was AOM’s only fatal accident and a hull loss during its operations.

Louis de Gonzague, Duke of Nevers
(
Italian
:
Ludovico
or
Luigi di Gonzaga-Nevers
; 18 September 1539 - 23 October 1595) was a soldier, governor and statesman during the
French Wars of Religion
. His father and brother were reigning dukes of
Mantua
. He came to France in 1549, and fought for
Henri II of France
during the latter
Italian Wars
, getting himself captured during the
battle of Saint Quentin
. Due to his Italian connections he was seen as a useful figure to have as governor of French Piedmont, a post he would hold until
Henri III
ceded the territory in 1574. In 1565 his patron,
Catherine de' Medici
secured for him a marriage with the key heiress
Henriette de Clèves
, elevating him to duke of Nevers and count of Rethelois. He fought for the crown through the early wars of religion, receiving a bad injury in the third war. At this time he formed a close bond with the young Anjou, future king Henri III, a bond that would last until the king's death.
He opposed any drive to war with Spain in 1572, and after the
attempt on Admiral Coligny's life
was a key member of the council that decided on the policy of elimination for the Protestant leadership. A radical Catholic, he revelled in his involvement in the
Massacre
that unfolded in the subsequent days. In the fourth war of religion he was the de facto leader of the
siege of La Rochelle
but was unable to bring it success. In the fifth civil war his army shadowed that of the
duke of Alençon
brother of the new king Henri, not giving battle, but containing him until Catherine negotiated a settlement. Nevers was disgusted with the generous
Peace of Monsieur
that concluded the civil war, joining the
ligue
movement that spread in the wake of it among radical Catholics, and campaigning for the resumption of war which was soon achieved. He now acted in the sixth civil war as the de facto leader of Alençon's now loyal army, campaigning brutally along the Loire, sacking
La Charité-sur-Loire
and
Issoire
, the war concluding in the harsher
Treaty of Bergerac
.
Nevers was again tempted to join the
ligue
during the second wave of the movement after the death of Alençon. Briefly serving as a commander for their forces in 1584, before he was pealed off from the movement in 1585 and returned to loyally supporting Henri. In 1588 he was chosen to replace
the Prince of Condé
as governor of Picardie. He would try and fail to receive the submission of several
ligue
towns in the governate for the king. In 1589 he would be replaced in the governate, and granted the role of governor of Champagne instead, a role he held in the name of his son. After the
assassination of the Duke of Guise
he was courted by the insurgent
ligueurs
in Paris who wanted to bring him over to the cause, but he rebuffed their advances. He virulently urged the king in the chaos that followed, not to come to terms with his heir
Navarre
but the king refused his advice, and formed an alliance, despite this Nevers remained loyal. On the death of the king, he again flirted with the
ligue
before committing himself to
Henri IV
serving him in Champagne, and then in failed diplomatic negotiations with the Pope after his abjuration from Protestantism. After briefly serving on his financial council, he died in 1595.
Early life and family
[
edit
]
Born in
Mantua
in 1539, he was the third child of
Frederick II Gonzaga
,
Duke of Mantua
, and
Margaret Palaeologina
.
[1]
[2]
His brother
Guglielmo
became the duke of Mantua.
[3]
At the age of 10 he was sent to
Paris
to inherit the assets left by his grandmother,
Anne d'Alençon
, widow of Marquess
Gugiliemo IX
of
Montferrat
.
[4]
Marriage
[
edit
]
On 4 March 1565 Nevers was married to the heiress
Henriette de Clèves
who brought with her to the marriage the Nivernais and the county of the Rethelois.
Catherine de Medici
had helped engineer this marriage for her favourite.
[5]
As such Louis de Gonzague became duke of Nevers
jure uxoris.
[6]
This was due to the extinction of the male line with the death of
Jacques de Clèves, Duke of Nevers
the previous year.
[7]
Nevers was supported in his militant Catholicism by his wife, who shared his proclivities for uncompromising Catholicism. Henriette's sisters would marry
Henri I, Duke of Guise
, another leader militant Catholic, and
Henri, Prince of Condé
, who would be one of the leader Protestant rebels in the later wars of religion.
[8]
Children
[
edit
]
His first son held the title of
comte de Rethelois
during his lifetime.
[9]
Their son
Charles
became
duke of Mantua
in 1627, establishing the Gonzaga-Nevers line. Charles' grandson,
Charles II, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat
, sold the titles of Nevers and Rethel to
Cardinal Mazarin
in 1659.
[10]
[11]
Louis, Duke of Nevers, and his wife had five children:
[12]
Catherine Gonzaga (21 January 1568 - 1 December 1629), married
Henry I, Duke of Longueville
[12]
Maria Henrietta Gonzaga (3 September 1571 - 3 August 1614), married
Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne
[12]
Frederick Gonzaga (11 March 1573 - 22 April 1574).
[12]
Francis Gonzaga (17 September 1576 - 13 June 1580).
[12]
Charles I, Duke of Mantua
(6 May 1580 - 20 September 1637).
[12]
Reign of Henri II
[
edit
]
In 1549, Nevers emigrated from Italy, setting himself up in the court of the recently crowned
Henri II
.
[3]
He fought with Henri in the latter
Italian Wars
, and was one of the many high nobles captured after the disastrous
battle of Saint-Quentin
in 1557.
[4]
The
Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis
that brought the
Italian Wars
to a close featured a joust as part of the celebrations. Henri decided to compete as was his habit, however his joust against
Gabriel de Lorges, Count of Montgomery
went awry, and he received a large shard of wood into his eye. Nevers who was present reported on what had happened to his Italian compatriots.
[13]
Reign of François II
[
edit
]
As an important
Prince étranger
, Nevers was among the notables called to attend the
Assembly of Notables
in 1560, the assembly brought together by the
Guise
government in response to the financial and religious crisis that had recently been laid bare by the
Conspiracy of Amboise
in which malcontents tried to overthrow their government and kidnap the king. This assembly concluded that an
Estates General
was necessary to meet France's financial problems,
one would meet later that year
and that a general religious council was needed to resolve the problem of Protestantism.
[14]
Reign of Charles IX
[
edit
]
By the mid-1560s, Nevers had received the position of lieutenant-general of the
Piedmont
, responsible for the military security of the remaining French possessions in Italy.
[15]
He would maintain his hold on this strategic post into the 1570s.
[16]
In the peace that followed the first war of religion, there was not much opportunity for promotion within the companies under Nevers command, however that changed with the return of war, with 12 promotions within his units in October 1567 alone.
[17]
Second war of religion
[
edit
]
At the start of the second war of religion, negotiations flew back and forth between
the Prince of Condé
and the crown as
Catherine de Medici
tried to persuade him to call off his rebellion. One of the terms Condé demanded for laying down his arms was a removal of all 'Italians' from court, by which he meant Nevers,
Albert de Gondi
,
Jacques de Savoie, duke of Nemours
. This would become a common demand of rebels during the French Wars of Religion, with the king's brother
Alençon
demanding similarly when he joined the
Malcontents
in 1575.
[18]
Condé, who had been besieging Paris, was dislodged after the
battle of Saint Denis
and began moving east, hoping to link up with an army of German
reiters
. The royal army after some delay pursued him from Paris, while Nevers brought a separate army up from the south, exiting his governorship in Piedmont, and marching through Burgundy, gathering more forces in Lyon including a contingent of Swiss to join in the hunt for the battered prince's army before it could escape. En route he captured the town of
Mâcon
which had gone over to the rebels at the start of the war.
[19]
They would be unsuccessful in this hunt and Condé slipped over the frontier into the Empire.
[20]
In January the secondary armies of Nevers and
Claude, Duke of Aumale
would link up with the main royal body at
Vitry-le-François
, exhausted after the pursuit of the Protestant force.
[21]
With the return of the rebel army, it was agreed that the army would split up to pursue it, with Anjou taking the main body again to shadow them from the north, while Nevers harassed them from the south. The Protestant army marched on
Chartres
and put the city to siege, while the royal forces found themselves racked with illness, and lack of pay, forcing them to return to Paris and allow the Protestant siege. Before the siege could conclude, a
peace settlement
would be reached
[22]
Nevers had spent March urging Anjou not to depart from Paris to confront the Protestants until such time as their German
reiters
arrived, which Nevers felt was critical to victory, however they would not do so until peace had been declared.
[23]
During the third war that followed in 1568, Nevers would receive a serious leg wound, which compromised his ability to lead a military life, pushing him more into the role of statesman going forward, though he would continue to hold commands.
[5]
Friendship
[
edit
]
He took the young
Anjou
brother of the king under his wing after 1568, acting as his intellectual and political adviser, warning him away from closeness with the
Guise
, telling Anjou that their family was the principal cause of the crowns current weakness. His continued hostility to the Guise, who he disparaged both for their great power over the state and due to their somewhat deficient learning, in particular that of
Louis II, Cardinal of Guise
, came despite the fact that
Henri I, Duke of Guise
was, by 1570, his brother in law, with both men married to daughters of
François I, Duke of Nevers
.
[24]
Peace
[
edit
]
In 1571, with
the Admiral de Coligny
pushing hard for a war with
Spain
to 're-unite Catholic and Protestant behind the crown' Nevers found himself in virulent opposition on council to such a scheme. He was not alone in opposition, all other members of the council bar Coligny were uninterested in such a venture and informed the king they opposed it. Nevers however had his intellectual protégé Anjou to make his case for him. His opposition came not only on grounds of principal, disliking the thought of declaring war on a Catholic monarch in favour of a Protestant adviser to the king, but also strategic, feeling that France would be fatally compromised when Spanish forces attacked from their Italian holdings.
[25]
He did not leave himself at this however, and alongside having Anjou argue his position, he was among those leading councillors who prepared memoranda highlighting the dangers of a war with Spain.
[26]
In 1572 Nevers purchased from
Charles IX
, the Grand Nesle, an old townhouse located just east of the
Tour de Nesle
on the
Left Bank
of Paris. Nevers had it reconstructed, after which it became known as the
Hôtel de Nevers
.
[27]
Although it was never completed, it was greatly admired by contemporaries. Nevers' secretary,
Blaise de Vigenère
, a distinguished antiquarian and art historian, wrote that the house had a
vault
, built by Italian workmen, which was more grand than the one at the
Baths of Caracalla
. Although De Vigenère likely overstated the size, it must have been very impressive and was an architectural feature that was new to Paris.
[28]
Radical
[
edit
]
In August 1572, shortly before the upcoming royal marriage, a smaller marriage was held between the Prince of Condé and
Marie de Clèves
, the sister of Nevers' wife. Condé and Clèves were first cousins, and as such their marriage would require Papal dispensation to go ahead, both were Protestant however, and as such no dispensation was going to be forthcoming. The king gave his assent to the marriage, and it was decided that this would be sufficient without the dispensation. The leading Catholics of the court reacted in discuss to this, with the
Cardinal de Bourbon
accosting his nephew asking him how he dared marry a Protestant, and without Papal dispensation. Condé replied the only dispensation he required was that of the king, causing Bourbon to leave in disgust.
Louis, Duke of Montpensier
spoke dark words to the king himself before joining the cardinal in storming out. He was followed by the two brothers in law of the bride,
Henri I, Duke of Guise
and Nevers, neither of whom had any stomach for this arrangement on religious grounds.
[29]
Wedding
[
edit
]
During the celebrations for the wedding of
Navarre
to the king's sister
Marguerite de Valois
,
Coligny was non-fatally shot
while walking home from the
Louvre
. Nevers was among the many candidates accused by the ambassadors present in Paris of involvement in the attempted hit.
[30]
The court was immediately plunged into crisis as the already tense capital became a powder keg, with a real prospect of civil war resuming, and Coligny's Protestant followers in the city threatening revenge on the killer. Rumours swirled that Nevers, Guise and other leading Catholics would be revenged upon for their alleged involvement in the attack.
[31]
On 23 August, Catherine assembled a meeting of her close advisers, among them Nevers, Gondi and
Tavannes
, the group agreed that crisis could be averted with a targeted strike to eliminate the main Protestant leadership.  For Nevers it was not a matter of religion, but rather concerns over the ambitions of Coligny that drove him towards this policy.
[32]
The targeted strike would not however proceed as planned, and shortly the whole of Paris was in the throws of a
Massacre
, Nevers reacted to this turn of events with glee, interpreting it as gods will that the situation would develop this way, he described the days of the massacre, in which thousands died, as a spiritual experience in which he came closer to god. The king was not pleased with this development however, and Nevers and
Henri d'Angoulême
both of whom had been heavily involved in the killings were called to the Louvre and sent out with orders to get the killings to stop on the morning of 24 August.
[33]
He would be a poor ambassador for this message, the units under his command and those of Anjou, which had originally been tasked with conducting various hits on the leadership, joined in as the bloodshed spread, while those under Nevers' enemy Guise held back once they had achieved the satisfaction of executing their enemy Coligny.
[34]
Though he was keen to 'cleanse' Paris of the Protestants he was not entirely insensitive to diplomatic needs. When he encountered the terrified
English ambassador
besieged in his house, Nevers drove away the besiegers and placed the ambassador under guard.
[35]
Massacre of Saint Bartholomew
[
edit
]
Keen to spread the
massacre into the provinces
, Nevers likely instructed his men to perpetrate the massacre that occurred in La Charité-sur-Loire, his forces arriving on 26 August.
[36]
[37]
Meanwhile
La Rochelle
a largely Protestant town, horrified at the massacre's across France, entered rebellion against the crown. Charles was determined to restore its obedience and a
siege
began. Nevers was among the host of nobles who were present on the siege lines for the unsuccessful effort to the reduce the town, the siege being called off after its commander was called off to become king of
Poland-Lithuania
.
[38]
Indeed, Nevers was de facto leader of the military effort against the city, while it remained under the nominal command of Anjou.
[39]
The king was not happy with this choice, and told Anjou he would prefer if the prince followed Retz as opposed to Nevers.
[40]
During the siege Nevers had commanded the siege lines against the northern wall of the city and the bastion of Evangile.
[41]
He quarrelled incessantly with the commander of the siege's artillery
the baron de Biron
who resented being subordinated to Nevers despite his authority over the city.
[42]
[39]
He was critical of the common soldiers, who he accused of being unenthusiastic about conducting assaults, failing to follow their officers.
[43]
With the siege concluded Anjou went first to Paris before departing, to explain the conduct of the operation, Retz and Nevers travelled with him, both of them having conduct to explain. All three of them would submit proposals to the crown for administrative and military reforms to avoid another debacle like the siege.
[44]
Poland
[
edit
]
Anjou selected Nevers as one of the men to accompany him to the Commonwealth, still treating him as the chief adviser he had done since the 1560s. He was the princely exception among a retinue largely composed of secondary provincial nobility, mainly new men who Anjou had met on the siege lines of La Rochelle. Anjou was keen to disassociate himself from his mothers favourites for the most part.
[45]
As Anjou settled in as king, Nevers became increasingly frustrated that Anjou was choosing to spend more time with
Bellegarde
, leaving him increasingly out in the cold. Excusing himself as unable to tolerate the weather he departed from the king.
[46]
After Anjou returned from the country to become king of France as Henri III the two linked up again in Italy on the road home at
Venzone
.
[47]
Upon reaching
Turin
, Anjou was cajoled by his aunt to yield the French Piedmont possessions on the far side of the Alps (
Pinerolo
,
Savigliano
and
Perugia
). He readily agreed, without consultation with his council or any of his Italian advisers. Nevers was furious that he had not been consulted about this destruction of his governate, with only the marquisate of Saluzzo left as a French possession beyond the Alps. He insisted on formerly registering his disapproval.
[48]
Reign of Henri III
[
edit
]
Intellectual interests
[
edit
]
The new king was intellectually more curious than his young predecessors, and liked to hear philosophical discussions and debates, these lectures became known as the
Académie du Palais
, and Nevers was an infrequent attendee of these intellectual discourses. His wife Henriette also frequented them on occasion
[49]
The new king was keen on theatre, this worked well with Nevers, who in 1571 had invited the first troop of Italian players into Paris.
[50]
Nevers became one of the important patrons of the arts and sciences in 16th-century France.
[28]
He fostered
faience
production in the
Duchy of Nevers
, beginning in 1588 under the Italian masters, the brothers Augustin Conrade, Baptiste Conrade, and Dominique Conrade from
Albisola
, and Giulio Gambin, who had worked in
Lyon
.
[51]
Though a close friend of the new king, he remained strongly connected to his former patron Catherine, and as her personal influence declined with the king, he and Retz could often be relied to champion her views during council discussions.
[52]
The La Marcks had held the governorship of Normandie for some time, however in 1574
Henri-Robert de la Marck
died. Henri was beset by demands from his powerful nobles seeking to secure the office as replacement. Nevers claimed that while the king had been in the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
he had promised Nevers the office, and when Henri refused to grant it to him he flew into a rage and departed court. Henri would settle on splitting the key governorship into three instead, to dilute the power of the office.
[53]
Alençon
[
edit
]
After Alençon fled from court to join with the Malcontents, Henri struggled to find a commander to bring the young prince back to court. Eventually he turned to Nevers as his man for the job, a decision which was met with much laughter at court, due to the duke's war injuries that left him with a limp. Alençon travelled north to
Dreux
where he laid out the manifesto of his rebellion against the crown, lambasting his brother for relying on Italian advisers like Nevers for his administration. He began mustering forces at Dreux, far outmatching those that Nevers had brought with him to escort the prince back to the capital. Unable to militarily confront the prince he wrote to Catherine and Henri, explaining that his mission was not possible without reinforcements. His small force was also deteriorating, suffering defections to Alençon's camp in the days they faced off against one another. Catherine at first suggested to him trying to kidnap Alençon via covert means to avoid a direct confrontation, she then abandoned this policy.
[54]
Catherine decided to negotiate personally with her son, who had now departed Dreux towards the
Loire
. Nevers who had been following the prince, was instructed to go no further than
Chartres
and hold back while the queen mother negotiated. He would have no further military engagements with Alençon.
[55]
Ligueur
[
edit
]
The fifth war of religion was brought to a close with the generous
Peace of Monsieur
which was highly favourable to the Protestants, in the hopes of re-securing Alençon's loyalty to the crown. Militant Catholics reacted with disgust to the terms, and Nevers was among those who pushed for Henri to overturn the peace and ensure that there was only one religion in France. Nevers did not however exert much of his energies against the specifics of the piece as they related to a town of his,
Mézières
being given as surety to Condé, alienating much of the area from him and sending it into the arms of the local Guise clients.
[56]
Catherine listened to Nevers' demands for a resumption of war frustratedly, trying to impart to him that while she and her son supported a sole religion, the financial situation of the kingdom simply couldn't support a war to achieve that. The
Estates General of 1576
, called as a term of the peace, and the vote of the council, forced Henri to follow Nevers' advice and re-open war. Indeed, Nevers spoke passionately at the estates, conjuring up the language of a crusade in his urgings for France to expunge heresy.
[57]
At this time, Nevers was heavily in debt, with creditors through the
Parlements
such as the Séguiers, but he was soon to be bailed out of his financial situation by his patron Catherine, ensuring in future his greater loyalty to the crown.
[58]
Sixth war of religion
[
edit
]
In conflict once more, Henri decided the now loyal Alençon would lead the royal army against the Protestants. As a symbol of the reunited Valois dynasty. Alençon lacked much in the way of military skill however, so real authority in the army would rest with Nevers, supported by Guise and Mayenne. Indeed, the king instructed Nevers to keep Alençon safely away from any place on the field that might be in danger. Throughout this period Catherine was desperately seeking a way to achieve peace, Nevers remained in opposition to such a policy.
[59]
The army under Nevers command laid siege to La Charité, on the Loire, the site in which Nevers' soldiers had committed a massacre back in 1572. The army was of considerable size, however the bankrupt crown struggled to keep it in the field, with Henri writing to Nevers to ensure our 'deniers are used sparingly.' By late April 1577 Alençon wrote urgently to the king speaking of the plight of their men. Nevertheless, by 2 May the city surrendered, quickly falling prey to the starved and unpaid men of Nevers' army which brutally sacked the town. Alençon was received in glory when he returned to court, fêted and given all the credit for a victory the king had made sure he wasn't involved in. It was decided to continue the offensive on 8 May towards
Issoire
in the
Auvergne
. By now the royal army was only 5000 strong, and tried at first to negotiate with the city leaders, they were uninterested however, describing the siege as a violation of the peace edict. Keen to make an example of the town, the king instructed Nevers to proceed with a siege, and after 2 weeks of bombardment, the town was captured. Scenes of great brutality accompanied its fall, as every Protestant house in the town was burned to the ground, while the soldiers went about raping and murdering the inhabitants.
[60]
The army, now numbering 2000 men continued on into the
Limousin
, Nevers complaining to the king in letters about his lack of ammunition and his troops unwillingness to fight. The city of Limoges, keen to avoid the presence of these troops within its walls, offered the army 30,000 not to billet in the city. The king urged him to accept, and admitted he could not pay the army any more. Nevers and the remaining troops were recalled from the field.
[61]
While the army had achieved several successes on the Loire, it was unable to make much headway against the main Protestant centres, and the king came to terms with them in the harsher
Treaty of Bergerac
in September 1577.
[62]
Nevers was among the grandees who gathered in 1583 at the personal invitation of the king for an Assembly of Notables. 68 Notables in total attended to discuss reform programs for the kingdom. The intended course of the sessions was derailed however, by the Cardinal de Bourbon who fell on his knees and begged the king to restore singular Catholic worship in the kingdom.
[63]
Some progress was derived from the discussions however, and it was agreed that Henri would curb the extravagant expenditure that he had bestowed upon his favourites in the prior decade. In general the king was reinforced in his desire to reduce the spending required to upkeep the court.
[64]
Second
ligue
[
edit
]
At the foundation of the second
ligue
in 1584, it was hoped by Guise and
Philip II of Spain
that Nevers would be amenable to participating, and as such a place was reserved for him among the leadership of the group. The
ligue
aimed to block the right of succession of the Protestant Navarre to the French throne, now being next in line after the death of the king's brother Alençon. Unable to suppress his views on the succession he joined the
ligue
in 1584, but was not involved in any military operations, despite having been named commander of a
ligue
army in 1584.
[65]
[66]
He and the king were in unison in their opposition to Guise's usurpation of the governor of the town of Mézières, when he replaced the governor with his own man, however Guise refused to back down.
[67]
While the king would eventually satisfy himself with the new reality in the town, Nevers continued to angle for the prior office holder, succeeding in installing him in 1587.
[68]
After the
Treaty of Flaix
in 1585 in which the king capitulated to the
ligue
Catherine was able to negotiate his departure from it, restoring his loyalty to the crown.
[69]
After this point he remained loyal to the crown when faced with its successor.
[70]
As such when Henri faced off with the
ligueur
Charles, Duke of Aumale
who was trying to seize
Boulogne
as a staging ground for the
Spanish Armada
, the king appointed Nevers as governor of
Picardie
to replace the recently deceased
Prince of Condé
confident that he would reliably support the crown against Aumale's influence in the region.
[71]
The
ligueurs
refused to hand over the towns of
Douellens
or
Le Crotoy
to him.
[72]
This appointment proved brief however, and in January 1589, he was relieved of the office in favour of
Henri I d'Orléans, Duke of Longueville
, the son of
Léonor d'Orléans
who had governed Picardie from 1569 to 1573, and who was descended from the Valois through the
bastard of Orléans
.
[73]
In return for yielding the office, Nevers was offered the governorship of Champagne. He accepted, though he demanded that it be in the name of his son, as such while he governed Champagne, it would be his son who formerly held the office until his death, when his son unified the theoretical and practical control of the region.
[74]
To support him and his son as lieutenant-general of the region, Joachim de Dinteville was maintained, largely able to act as governor in his own right, due to the absence of the Gonzague from the province.
[75]
In August 1587, the king outlined how he planned to personally lead the army against the Protestant
reiters
who were crossing the border into France in support of Navarre. All of his council virulently opposed the suggestion, arguing it was far too dangerous. Nevers however stood alone in support of the proposal, arguing that if the king secured a victory against the Protestant mercenaries that it would disarm the ability of Guise to claim pre-eminence as a defender of Catholicism. The king liked this idea and sent Guise with inadequate forces to block the German approach while he commanded the main body. His plan did not proceed as expected however, the German army began to disintegrate after crossing into France and was picked off by Guise in two battles.
[76]
Guise
[
edit
]
The
Estates General of 1588
required the presence of Guise, as such he abdicated his command of the army in Poitou to Nevers while he went to attend to the sessions, hoping they would support his
ligueur
proposals against the king.
[77]
The king faced a
ligueur
assembly and was compelled into humiliating concessions. In return the Estates granted him a small sum of 120,000
livres
while offering 100,000
livres
directly to the armies under Mayenne and Nevers.
[78]
With the various humiliations forced upon him by the Guise and
Ligue
the king resolved to have them killed. In December 1588 his assassination plot fired, and the duke of Guise was murdered while attending a council session. The cardinal de Guise meanwhile was aggressively interrogated by the king's men, and confessed under duress that there was a plan for Nevers and other Catholic notables to capture the king.
[79]
Collapse of royal authority
[
edit
]
In the wake of these assassinations, Paris rose up and declared for the
ligue.
The new
ligue
administration of the city, the 'sixteen', urged Nevers to join them. After several weeks he responded, informing the
ligue
that he was of course sympathetic to their desires for a country free of heresy, but chastising them for trying to achieve it in defiance of the king. He highlighted recent reversals for the Catholic cause in Europe, at the
Battle of Coutras
, the
Spanish Armada
and other defeats, informing the city that these were gods punishment for internal Catholic divisions. He warned the city that if they continued in this manner, France might face a ruin akin to that of the
Byzantine Empire
. The sixteen shot back that if he continued to be loyal to the king his honour would be tarnished, but he refused to entertain their advances.
[80]
The late dukes wife
Catherine de Clèves
was equally optimistic Nevers might be a tool against the 'monster' who had murdered her husband, however he rebuffed her advances also.
[81]
His vassal town in Rethel, that of Mézières informed him that he had to declare his intentions, or else the town would declare for the
ligue
, he allowed the deadline to expire and the town joined the 'holy union'.
[82]
The king licked his wounds in
Tours
as his situation spiralled out of control. Many of his advisors urged him to come to terms with Navarre, forming an alliance against the
ligue.
Nevers bitterly opposed such suggestions, outlining a picture of a ruined lawless France where Catholicism was illegal if such an alliance came to pass. Henri ignored these warnings, deciding to come to terms with his heir. Nevers in disgust departed the court, however he merely retired to his estates, not entering the
ligue
camp. From his home in the Nivernois he promised Henri he was still loyal and that he would suffer the afflictions god would send to him for his sins of remaining loyal to the crown. The two maintained contact over the following months
[83]
By June Nevers had become aware of plots to kill the king, writing in disgust to a friend of the wicked and sinful schemes to harm the lawful king. The following month Henri would be assassinated by the radical Catholic
Jacques Clément
.
[84]
Reign of Henri IV
[

War against the
ligue
[
edit
]
With the assassination of Henri III, the matter of his service to a Protestant king was immediately put to the test. Nevers wavered, departing from the royal army to his estates and offering vague overtures to the
ligue
for a couple of months, however he was secured for the royal fold.
[85]
[86]
Fighting for his new king, in 1590 the combat reached Champagne as the
duke of Lorraine
invaded France in support of the
ligue
. He quickly captured Villefranche, the commander of whom was promptly hanged by Nevers for having yielded too easily to the attackers.
[87]
Two years later Henri would campaign against the
ligue
in the region. Nevers urged him on to reduce the town of Épernay. Biron was killed in the initial attempt, and when reinforced by troops under Nevers, the town was captured, a heavy blow to the nearby
ligueurs
in
Reims
.
[88]
In 1593 he held
Beauce
for the crown against any attempts to seize it by the
ligue.
[89]
Chaumont held out until 1594, when upon hearing of the fall of Paris to Henri, the town councillors opened up lines of communication to Dinteville and Nevers, surrendering the town.
[90]
Guise continued holding out until October 1594, hoping to receive the governorship of Champagne, the king however was not willing to deprive the Gonzague-Nevers of this privilege and he was offered the governorship of Provence in return for surrendering Reims and the other towns under his control.
[91]
Diplomat
[
edit
]
Nevers was given the sensitive task by Henri IV in 1593 of communicating his conversion to Catholicism to the Pope, such that he could be granted absolution. Achieving absolution was seen as a necessary pre-requisite to the acceptance of many of the Catholic magnates who backed the
ligue.
In response the
ligue
sent the Jesuit Antonio Possevino to argue against Nevers. Nevers faced an uphill battle in his task, being accepted into Rome only due to his Mantuan nobility, and not as a representative of the 'Béarnais' the
ligueur
pejorative for Henri IV. As he and his allies worked to bring the Pope round, the
ligueurs
fell into disagreement over whether the Pope granting absolution was enough to make Henri acceptable as king.
[92]
While Nevers had been told he would not be accepted as an ambassador, this was not confirmed until January 1594, and came as a heavy blow to the royalist camp.
[93]
Henri tried again in 1595, and after meeting several conditions for the Pope, was granted absolution in September of that year.
[94]
Finance and death
[
edit
]
Upon the death of
François d'O
in 1594, who had monopolised the financial administration of the kingdom, the
conseil des finances
was reconstituted. It would consist of four sword nobles: Retz,
Damville
, Schomberg and Nevers, and other figures from the administrative nobility. The group set about engaging in every fiscal expedient they could imagine to raise finances for the kingdom, selling off offices, leasing out royal territory, floating loans and creating new offices to sell.
[95]
In 1595, he died.

Ann Wood Henry
(January 21, 1734 - March 8, 1799) served as treasurer of
Lancaster County
,
Pennsylvania
, and became the first woman in Pennsylvania's history to hold public office. She was the wife of
William Henry
, a gunsmith, inventor, delegate to the
Continental Congress
, and patriot in the
American Revolution
.
[1]
[2]
[3]
Background
[
edit
]
Born Ann Wood in
Burlington
,
Province of New Jersey
on January 21, 1734, she married William Henry in 1756; the couple had thirteen children, including
John Joseph Henry
(1758-1811), a judge; William Henry, who moved to
Nazareth
,
Province of Pennsylvania
and carried on his father's gunsmith business; and Benjamin West Henry (1777-1806), a painter, named after the famous painter who had, in 1756, lodged in the Henry home.
Benjamin West
painted portraits of both Ann and William Henry, as well as the precocious "Death of Socrates", which was passed down in the Henry family until 1989 (when the will of Mary Henry Stites bequeathed it to the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania
).
According to the best available information, Ann Henry was an upper-class woman with means who was primarily focused on attending to the domestic sphere of her and her husband's household.
[4]
When William went to fight during the war, Ann was responsible for taking over his duties.
[4]
William held multiple leadership positions in the state in judicial, legislative, and military spheres.
[5]
The couple and their 13 children were reportedly deeply involved in the church.
[4]
The Henry household during the
Revolutionary War
was an important military and intellectual center. During the British occupation of Philadelphia,
David Rittenhouse
, then Treasurer for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, stayed in the Henry home, as did
Thomas Paine
, who wrote his fifth
Crisis
there. According to John Joseph Henry, who was in Lancaster recuperating from injuries suffered while serving with
Benedict Arnold
in Quebec, Paine's indolence and irreligion disgusted Ann Henry. William Henry continuously fought sickness and eventually died from it which left Ann as his widow.
[4]
After the death of her husband, Ann took the position of treasurer (like William had been) of
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania
.
[5]
She served the rest of his term as well as her own.
[5]
Evidently, Ann was the first woman in Pennsylvania's history to become a public official.
[5]
She died on January 8, 1799, and was buried two days later in the Moravian cemetery in Lancaster.

Former research center at Princeton University
The
Center of International Studies
[1]
(CIS) was a research center that was part of
Princeton University
's
Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs
in
Princeton, New Jersey
.  It was founded in 1951 by six scholars who came to Princeton from
Yale Institute of International Studies
under the leadership of the center's first director, Frederick S. Dunn.  By 1999, its stated mission was to "promote world peace and mutual understanding among nations by supporting scholarship in international relations and national development" and to "support analysis of abiding questions in international security and political economy".
[2]
In 2003, the center was merged with the university's regional studies programs to form the considerably larger
Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies
.
Origins
[
edit
]
The
Yale Institute of International Studies
had existed since 1935, but during 1950-51, ran into a conflict with the new
President of Yale University
,
A. Whitney Griswold
, who felt that scholars should conduct research as individuals rather than in cooperative groups
[3]
and who thought that the institute should do more historical, detached analysis rather than focus on current issues and recommendations on policy.
[4]
In addition there was some personal animosity involved, related to Griswold believing that institute members had argued against his receiving tenure.
[5]
In April 1951, the longtime director of the Yale institute,
Frederick Sherwood Dunn
(who was a Princeton alumnus),
[6]
together with five of his political science colleagues - Percy Corbett,
Gabriel Almond
, Klaus Knorr,
William Kaufmann
, and
Bernard C. Cohen
- all left Yale and came to Princeton.
[3]
With the goal of strengthening
international studies
within the
Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs
, the Center of International Studies was thus created.
[7]
It was initially funded by donations, including a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation
, which had also sponsored the Yale institute.
[3]
It also received a substantial gift from the
Milbank Memorial Fund
.
[8]
Dunn became the first director of the new body.
[7]
The
President of Princeton University
,
Harold W. Dodds
, said that the new center would focus its attentions on the problems of foreign policy and conflicting national policies, would work with the
U.S. State Department
and other governmental agencies, and declared that, "Basic research in the foreign policies and behavior of nations is just as essential as research in physical science and engineering if the United States is to achieve security and avoid catastrophic total war."
[3]
The news of the shift from Yale to Princeton made the front page of
The New York Times
.
[3]
Dodds used a metaphor from
American football
to summarize the events: "Yale fumbled and Princeton recovered the ball."
[5]
The new center became known as the continuation of the old Yale institute, and terms such as "migration" or "moved" have been used.
[9]
[10]
One government publication later termed the center a "reincarnation".
[11]
Structure and work
[
edit
]
The Center of International Studies was housed in Wilson (later renamed Corwin) Hall (
left
) during the 1950s through 1980s, and then in Bendheim Hall (
center
) during the 1990s and 2000s.
The center's structure had a faculty committee overseeing it, chaired by Dunn, that included some of Princeton's well-known historians; research associates, initially consisting largely of those who had come over from Yale; and visiting fellows, of whom many were
postdoctoral researchers
.
[8]
In its early years, the official statement of purpose for the center read:
The program of the Center of International Studies falls into two principal divisions. The first is concerned with the development of methods an analysis appropriate to the study of international relations and foreign policy. The second is research in specific problems of world politics with special reference to the foreign policy of the United States.
[8]
The creation of the center was part of a group of such research facilities that came into being in the aftermath of
World War II
to pursue
international security studies
.
[12]
Another was
Columbia University
's
Institute of War and Peace Studies
, also created in 1951 and whose founding director,
William T. R. Fox
, had been associate director of the Yale Institute of International Studies but had departed a year earlier.
[12]
Indeed, both Fox and his wife,
Annette Baker Fox
, had also been listed as coming to the Center of International Studies as part-time research associates,
[13]
leading to some accounts increasing the total number coming to Princeton from Yale from six to seven or eight.  She did work for the center
[12]
during 1951-57 while he was there only during 1951-52. More important was the influence he had at Columbia; some of the Princeton center's research scholars who were hired later in the early 1950s, such as
Warner R. Schilling
and
Roger Hilsman
, would later end up at the Columbia institute.
[12]
[14]
Integration with the existing political science department at Princeton was not always smooth, for Dodds had not apprised them in advance of the newcomers.
[15]
Due to this Almond fairly soon departed,
[15]
and Kaufman and Cohen left later in the decade as well.
Subsequent directors of the Center of International Studies were Knorr, who served in the position from 1960 to 1968,
[16]
and history professor
Cyril E. Black
, from 1968 to 1985.
[17]
Henry Bienen
served as director until 1992, when
John Waterbury
took over.
[18]
He served in that role until around 1997-98,
[19]
when
Michael W. Doyle
took it over until 2001.
[20]
[21]
Aaron Friedberg
served as acting director, and then director, of the center, culminating in 2002-03.  Continued funding from the center came from a variety of Princeton sources, outside grants from foundations, and from research-related federal agencies.
[22]
Beginning in 1970, a grant from the
Fund for Peace
sponsored the Compton fellowship, named after a Princeton student killed in World War II and whose parents created the fund.
[22]
[23]
Signage for the center could still be seen some years after the end of its existence.
The center also took over from the Yale institute the sponsorship of the quarterly academic journal
World Politics
.
[3]
[4]
Dunn served as chair of its editorial board for a period
[6]
and Knorr served as it editor for a decade.
[16]
By 1975, it was ranked the highest in quality of over sixty journals in its field.
[22]
Both the Yale Institute and the Princeton Center have been considered bastions of
international relations realism
[4]
although influential academic organizer
Kenneth W. Thompson
saw the Princeton center as a growing home for
behaviorism
.
[9]
As the
RAND Corporation
, formed around the same time, took the lead in security studies, the center helped forge a bridge between RAND and academia.
[4]
Over time, the center's work developed into a
multidisciplinary approach
that used
cross-cultural studies
, and its researchers included not just political scientists but also historians, economists, and sociologists.
[22]
In addition to the directors, other scholars of note to work in the center included
Richard A. Falk
.
[22]
Black and Falk edited a multi-volume study,
The Future of the International Legal Order
, beginning in 1969, that combined the efforts of over three dozen scholars from nearly as many institutions; it would win an award from the
American Society of International Law
in 1973.
[22]
By 1978, some 90 books had been published in connection with the center, with half coming from scholars outside of Princeton.
[22]
In some cases, limited teaching responsibilities enabled the researchers to focus their efforts on producing books.
[5]
The title of one book, 1960's
The Politics of the Developing Areas
, was responsible for spreading that term into the academic world.
[5]
By 1999, the center consisted of some sixty-five faculty associates, who belonged to several different departments within the university, and about ten visiting fellows at any given time.
[2]
Merging
[
edit
]
In 2003, the Center of International Studies was merged with the Council on Regional Studies, which had been an interdepartmental organization of
regional study programs
, to form the considerably larger
Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies
.
[24]
University President
Shirley M. Tilghman
said that, "This new institute will build on two long-established areas of strength at Princeton to bring an even greater global perspective to teaching and research at this University".
[24]
The first director of the new institute was a Latin American studies scholar.
[24]
The new institute continued to sponsor the
World Politics
journal.

.
History
[
edit
]
Founded in 1909 by
Southwestern University
,
Austin College
,
Texas Christian University
,
Texas
,
Texas A&M
,
Baylor University
and
Trinity University
the TIAA had a changing set of members that spun off into the
Southwest Conference
,
Lone Star Conference
and the
Texas Conference
. The league had been formed to rid college athletics of objectionable elements like gambling and place them entirely under the control of the schools. At first the league worked well, but soon the disparity in the sizes of the schools became an issue. The large state schools, with bigger stadiums and crowds, began to refuse to travel to the smaller schools and insisted on playing that at home.
[1]
This battle between the large and small schools led to the first big change in 1914, when Texas, A&M, Baylor and Southwestern left to form the
Southwest Conference
, with some considering themselves to be members of both. After two seasons, Southwestern left the Southwest conference and returned to the TIAA. The conferences became completely separate in 1917. In 1922, TIAA expanded by including North Texas.
[2]
In 1923, TCU left to join the Southwest Conference and in 1924,
Rice
followed suit.
In 1925, the TIAA was split between members who wanted to allow freshmen and transfers to play and schools that did not. This fault line also separated the teachers colleges that had joined over the years and the church-sponsored schools that had been founders. In May 1925, those that wanted to allow them to play—Trinity, Simmons University (now
Hardin-Simmons University
),
Austin College
,
Howard Payne
, and Southwestern—left to form the
Texas Conference
, but they agreed to play out the fall 1925 football season within the TIAA. Play within the Texas Conference began with the 1926 basketball season. The five departing schools were all church supported and agreed to ally themselves "along denominational lines."
[2]
[3]
By 1930, the TIAA had expanded back to 11 members. This included teachers colleges such as
Sul Ross
,
West Texas
,
East Texas
,
North Texas
,
Sam Houston
,
Stephen F. Austin
, and
Southwest Texas
as well as
Abilene Christian College
, Daniel Baker,
Texas A&I
and
McMurry
. But in May 1931, five TIAA schools joined together to form the
Lone Star Conference
. These were Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, East Texas, Southwest Texas and North Texas.
[4]
[2]
As a result, the conference was dissolved in 1932. Many of the members became independents and eventually wound up in the short-lived
Alamo Conference
.

Lymphocyte-specific protein 1
is a
protein
that in humans is encoded by the
LSP1
gene
.
[5]
[6]
This gene encodes an intracellular
F-actin
binding protein. The protein is expressed in
lymphocytes
,
neutrophils
,
macrophages
, and
endothelium
and may regulate neutrophil motility, adhesion to
fibrinogen
matrix proteins, and transendothelial migration.
Alternative splicing
results in multiple transcript variants encoding different
isoforms

The
Eureka Theatre Company
was an American
repertory
theatre
group located in
San Francisco, California
. It was founded in 1972 as the Shorter Players by
Chris Silva
,
Robert Woodruff
and
Carl Lumbly
.
[1]
In 1974 its name was changed to the Eureka Theatre. In October 1981 the company was staging
David Edgar
's
The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs
[2]
when their space in the basement of the Trinity Methodist Church burned in an arson attack.
[3]
: 27
By 1990 the company had moved to an industrial building at 2730 16th Street in the Mission.
[3]
: 65
The company is noted because in 1986
Oskar Eustis
, then its dramaturg,
[3]
: 26
and
Tony Taccone
, then its artistic director,
[3]
: 25
commissioned a play from
Tony Kushner
.
[3]
: 33
Eustis had seen Kushner's play
A Bright Room Called Day
in New York.
[3]
: 31
The contract specified it should run no more than 2 hours, and include songs.
[3]
: 34
With help from a $50,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts,
[3]
: 34
it eventually turned into
Angels in America
, two three-and-a-half hour plays with no songs. In 1991 the company staged the world premiere of the first part,
Millennium Approaches
and staged readings of the second part,
Perestroika
, which was still being written.
[3]
: 67
The cost of staging
Angels in America
, about $250,000, ended the Eureka's career as a production company,
[3]
: 78
although they continued to present plays,
[2]
In 1998 the company took over the Gateway Theater in Jackson Square.
[4]
Due to rising costs and the 2013 diversion of San Francisco's hotel tax fund away from the arts
[5]
the company closed on 5 July 2017.

The
Tony Award
for Best Special Theatrical Event
was awarded from 2001 to 2009 to live theatrical productions that were not plays or musicals.
[1]
The category was created after the 2000 controversy of
Contact
winning
Best Musical
; the show used pre-recorded music and featured no singing.
[2]
The category was retired in 2009
[3]
allowing the shows that were previously eligible for it to be eligible in Best Play or Best Musical categories, if they met the proper criteria. The shows are also now eligible in other creative categories.
In 1999 and 2000 a
Special Tony Award for a Live Theatrical Presentation
was awarded which may be seen as the precursor of the
Best Special Theatrical Event
award and is generally included in this award's listing.

Our Friends, the Hayseeds
is a 1917 Australian rural comedy from director
Beaumont Smith
. It centers on the rural family, the
Hayseeds
, and their rivalry with a neighbouring family, the
Duggans
.
It was Smith's first movie as a director and was a popular success at the box office, leading to a number of sequels. However no known copy of it exists today and it is considered a
lost film
.
Synopsis
[
edit
]
The Hayseeds and Duggaans live on
selections
next to each other. Joe Hayseed and Pansy Duggan want to get married but their families quarrel when the Hayseeds' cow gets into the Duggan's corn and they are forbidden to see each other. The two families have a brawl on the bush fence, a fight that only ends in exhaustion. However, a bush fire unites them and Jim and Pansy marry. Pansy falls pregnant and Dad Hayseed and Dad Duggan both hope for a boy which will be named after them. She ends up giving birth to twin girls.
[3]
The film was divided into four sections: the first two dealing with a day in the life of the Hayseeds; the last two under the title "Pansy's Wooing" with Joe and Pansy's courtship.
[1]
A contemporary reviewer said that of the film's 5,000 foot length, 1,000 feet was dedicated to humorous titles.

Production
[
edit
]
The movie was inspired by the success of
Bert Bailey
's stage adaptation of
Steele Rudd
's
Dad and Dave
stories,
On Our Selection
and
Philip Lytton
's play
The Waybacks
.  Smith had worked with Bailey and
Edmund Duggan
on the initial production of
Selection
.
[5]
Shooting took place on location in
South Australia
in
Campbelltown
and
Norwood
.
[1]
Many of the cast had appeared in
Beaumont Smith
's theatrical productions of
While the Billy Boils
(which he
filmed in 1921
) and
Seven Little Australians
.
[4]
While shooting the bushfire scene off the side of a hill at Campbelltown, the fire got out of control and momentarily trapped the actors. According to contemporary press reports, "they came out of that fire black as coal heavers, almost blind with smoke, and singed badly. Their faces were a study of horror and fear, and that heartless photographer turned the handle all the time. But he got a most realistic picture."
[6]
Reception
[
edit
]
The movie's local appeal was heavily advertised to South Australian audiences in publicity. The
Adelaide Mail
said of the film that "the tone was pleasing, and made an undeniably good impression on those who witnessed it... the film is splendidly put together. It contains but little plot, most of the scenes presenting incidents of everyday life. Some of the scenes, however, are a little drawn-out, particularly the fight between the Hayseed and Duggan families."
[1]
Box office response was strong and there were a number of sequels starting with
The Hayseeds Come to Sydney
. It was the first feature from theatrical entrepreneur
Beaumont Smith
who went on to become one of Australia's most prolific filmmakers of the silent era.

,
[2]
born 19 June 1964) is a British politician and writer who served as
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
and
Leader of the Conservative Party
from 2019 to 2022. He previously served as
Foreign Secretary
from 2016 to 2018 and as
Mayor of London
from 2008 to 2016. He was
Member of Parliament
(MP) for
Uxbridge and South Ruislip
from 2015 to 2023, having previously been MP for
Henley
from 2001 to 2008.
Johnson attended
Eton College
and studied
Classics
at
Balliol College, Oxford
. He was elected
president of the Oxford Union
in 1986. In 1989, he became the Brussels correspondent - and later political columnist - for
The Daily Telegraph
, and from 1999 to 2005 he was the editor of
The Spectator
. Following his election to Parliament in 2001, he became a member of the
shadow cabinets
of
Michael Howard
and later
David Cameron
. Johnson
was elected Mayor of London in 2008
and resigned from the
House of Commons
. He was
re-elected mayor in 2012
. In the
2015 general election
he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, and the following year did not seek re-election as mayor. Johnson was a prominent figure in the successful
Vote Leave
campaign for
Brexit
in the
2016 European Union membership referendum
. After the referendum, Prime Minister
Theresa May
appointed him foreign secretary in her
cabinet
. He resigned from the position in 2018 in protest at both the
Chequers Agreement
and May's approach to Brexit.
Johnson defeated
Jeremy Hunt
in the
2019 Conservative Party leadership election
to succeed May, who resigned after Parliament's repeated rejections of her
Brexit withdrawal agreement
. Johnson
re-opened Brexit negotiations
and in early September
prorogued Parliament
, with the
Supreme Court
later that month ruling the action to have been unlawful.
[b]
After agreeing to a revised Brexit withdrawal agreement which replaced the
Irish backstop
with the
Northern Ireland Protocol
, but
failing to win parliamentary support
for the agreement, Johnson called a
snap general election
to be held in December 2019. In
the election
, he led the Conservative Party to their largest victory since
1987
. On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union and entered a transition period of
trade negotiations
that led to the
EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
.
A decisive event that occurred during Johnson's premiership was the
COVID-19 pandemic
. The government
responded
to the pandemic by introducing various
emergency powers
and measures across the country to mitigate its impact and approved the rollout of a
nationwide vaccination programme
. He also responded to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine
by imposing
sanctions on Russia
and authorising
foreign aid and weapons shipments
to Ukraine.
[4]
In the
Partygate
scandal it was found that multiple parties had been held at
10 Downing Street
during
national COVID-19 lockdowns
, and COVID-19 social distancing laws were breached by 83 individuals, including Johnson, who in April 2022 was issued with a
fixed penalty notice
. The publishing of the
Sue Gray report
in May 2022 and a widespread sense of dissatisfaction led in June 2022 to a
vote of confidence
in his leadership among Conservative MPs, which he won. In July 2022, revelations over his
appointment of Chris Pincher
as deputy
chief whip
while knowing of allegations of sexual misconduct against him led to a
mass resignation of members of the government
and to Johnson announcing his resignation as prime minister. He left office on 6 September and was succeeded by
Liz Truss
, his foreign secretary. Johnson remained in the House of Commons as a
backbencher
until he resigned in June 2023, days before the
Privileges Committee investigation
unanimously found that he had lied to the Commons on numerous occasions.
Johnson is a
controversial figure
in British politics.
[5]
[6]
His supporters have praised him for being humorous, witty, and entertaining,
[7]
with an appeal reaching beyond traditional Conservative Party voters, making him an electoral asset to the party.
[8]
[9]
Conversely, his critics have accused him of lying,
elitism
,
cronyism
and
bigotry
.
[10]
[11]
[12]
As prime minister, his supporters praised him for "
getting Brexit done
", overseeing the UK's COVID-19 vaccination programme, which was initially amongst the fastest in the world, and providing global leadership following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
[13]
[14]
[15]
His tenure saw several controversies and scandals, and is viewed as the most scandalous premiership of modern times by historians and biographers.
[16]
Johnson's political positions
have been described as
one-nation conservative
, and commentators have characterised his political style as opportunistic,
populist
and pragmatic.
[17]
[18]
[19]
Early life
Childhood
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in the
Upper East Side
of
Manhattan
, New York City,
[20]
[21]
to 23-year-old
Stanley Johnson
, then studying economics at
Columbia University
,
[22]
and 22-year-old
Charlotte Fawcett
,
[23]
an artist from a family of liberal intellectuals. His birth in the US, a country with
jus soli
, makes him one of only two British Prime Ministers to have been an
American citizen
, along with
Winston Churchill
.
[24]
[25]
Johnson's parents had married in 1963 before moving to the United States.
[26]
They returned to the UK in September 1964, so that Charlotte could study at the
University of Oxford
.
[27]
During this time she lived with her son in
Summertown
, a suburb of
Oxford
, and in September 1965 she gave birth to a daughter,
Rachel
.
[28]
In July 1965, the family moved to
Crouch End
in
North London
,
[29]
and in February 1966 they relocated to Washington, DC, where Stanley had gained employment with the
World Bank
.
[30]
Stanley then took a job with a policy panel on
population control
, and moved the family to
Norwalk, Connecticut
, in June.
[31]
A third child, Leo, was born in September 1967.
[32]
Ashdown House
preparatory school, East Sussex, attended by Johnson from 1975 to 1977
The family returned to the UK in 1969, and they settled into West Nethercote Farm, Somerset, Stanley's remote family home in
Exmoor
.
[33]
There, Johnson gained his first experiences of
fox hunting
.
[34]
His father was regularly absent from Nethercote, leaving Johnson to be raised largely by his mother, assisted by
au pairs
.
[35]
As a child, Johnson was quiet, studious,
[29]
and deaf, resulting in several operations to insert
grommets
into his ears.
[36]
He and his siblings were encouraged to engage in intellectual activities from a young age,
[37]
with high achievement being greatly valued; Johnson's earliest recorded ambition was to be "world king".
[38]
Having no friends other than their siblings, the children became very close.
[39]
In late 1969, the family moved to
Maida Vale
in West London, while Stanley began
post-graduate
research at the
London School of Economics
.
[40]
In 1970, Charlotte and the children briefly returned to Nethercote, where Johnson attended Winsford Village School, before returning to London to settle in
Primrose Hill
,
[41]
where they were educated at Primrose Hill Primary School.
[42]
A fourth child and third son,
Joseph
, was born in late 1971.
[43]
After Stanley secured employment at the
European Commission
in April 1973, he moved his family to
Uccle
, Brussels, where Johnson attended the
European School, Brussels I
and learnt to speak French.
[44]
[45]
During this time, Charlotte had a
nervous breakdown
and was hospitalised with
clinical depression
, after which Johnson and his siblings were sent back to the UK in 1975 to attend
Ashdown House
, a preparatory boarding school in East Sussex.
[46]
There, he developed interests in
rugby
,
Ancient Greek
, and
Latin
.
[47]
While there, the teachers' use of
corporal punishment
appalled him.
[48]
Meanwhile, in December 1978 his parents' relationship broke down; they divorced in 1980,
[49]
and Charlotte moved into a flat in
Notting Hill
, West London, where her children joined her for much of their time.
[50]
Eton and Oxford: 1977-1987
As a kid I was extremely spotty, extremely nerdy and horribly
swotty
. My idea of a really good time was to travel across London on the tube to visit the
British Museum
.
— Boris Johnson
[51]
Johnson read Classics at
Balliol College, Oxford
.
Johnson gained a
King's Scholarship
to study at
Eton College
, a boarding school near
Windsor
in Berkshire.
[52]
Arriving in the autumn term of 1977,
[53]
he began using his middle name Boris rather than his first name Alexander,
[54]
and developed "the eccentric English persona" for which he became famous.
[55]
He denounced his Catholic faith and became an
Anglican
, joining the
Church of England
.
[56]
School reports complained about his idleness, complacency, and lateness,
[57]
but he was popular and well known at Eton.
[55]
Johnson's friends were largely from the wealthy upper classes; his best friends being
Darius Guppy
and
Charles Spencer
, both of whom later accompanied him at the
University of Oxford
and remained friends into adulthood.
[58]
Johnson excelled in
English
and the
Classics
, winning prizes in both,
[59]
and became secretary of the school
debating society
[60]
and editor of the school newspaper,
The Eton College Chronicle
.
[61]
In late 1981, he became a member of
Pop
,
[62]
a small, self-selecting elite and glamorous group of prefects. Later in Johnson's career it was a point of rivalry with
David Cameron
, who had failed to enter
Pop
. After leaving Eton, Johnson went on a
gap year
to Australia, where he taught English and Latin at
Timbertop
, an
Outward Bound
-inspired campus of
Geelong Grammar
, an independent boarding school.
[63]
[64]
[65]
Johnson won a scholarship to study
Literae Humaniores
at
Balliol College, Oxford
, a four-year course in the study of the Classics, ancient languages, literature, history, and philosophy.
[66]
Matriculating
at the university in late 1983,
[67]
he was one of a generation of Oxford undergraduates who were later to dominate British politics and media in the second decade of the 21st century; among them David Cameron,
William Hague
,
Michael Gove
,
Jeremy Hunt
and
Nick Boles
.
[68]
While at Oxford, Johnson participated in college
rugby union
, playing as a
tighthead prop
for
Balliol College
's team for four years.
[69]
To his later regret, he joined
Bullingdon Club
, an exclusive drinking society notorious for acts of vandalism on host premises.
[70]
[71]
[72]
Many years later,
a group photograph
including himself and Cameron in Bullingdon Club formal dress led to much negative coverage from the press. He began a relationship with
Allegra Mostyn-Owen
, cover girl for
Tatler
magazine and daughter of
Christie's Education
chairman
William Mostyn-Owen
. She was a glamorous and popular student from his own social background, and they became engaged while at university.
[73]
Johnson was popular and well known at Oxford.
[74]
Alongside Guppy, he edited the university's satirical magazine
Tributary
.
[75]
In 1984, Johnson was elected secretary of the
Oxford Union
,
[76]
and campaigned unsuccessfully for the career-enhancing and important position of
Union President
.
[77]
In 1986, Johnson ran successfully for President,
[78]
but his term was not distinguished or memorable,
[79]
and questions were raised regarding his competence and seriousness.
[80]
At graduation, Johnson was awarded an
upper second-class
degree,
[81]
[82]
and was deeply unhappy he did not receive a first.
[83]
Early career
The Times
and
The Daily Telegraph
: 1987-1994
In September 1987, Johnson and Mostyn-Owen were married in
West Felton
, Shropshire, accompanied by a duet for violin and viola
Allegra e Boris
[84]
specially commissioned for the wedding from
Hans Werner Henze
.
[85]
After a honeymoon in Egypt, they settled in
West Kensington
, London,
[86]
where he secured work for a
management consultancy
company,
L.E.K. Consulting
; he resigned after a week.
[87]
In late 1987, through family connections, he began work as a graduate trainee at
The Times
.
[88]
Scandal erupted when Johnson wrote an article for the newspaper, on the
archaeological
discovery of
Edward II
's palace, having invented a quote for the article which he falsely attributed to the historian
Colin Lucas
, his godfather. After the editor
Charles Wilson
learnt of the matter, he dismissed Johnson.
[89]
Johnson secured employment on the leader-writing desk of
The Daily Telegraph
, having met its editor,
Max Hastings
, while at Oxford University.
[90]
His articles appealed to the newspaper's conservative, middle-class, middle-aged "
Middle England
" readership,
[91]
and were known for their distinctive literary style, replete with old-fashioned words and phrases and for regularly referring to the readership as "my friends".
[92]
In early 1989, Johnson was appointed to the newspaper's Brussels bureau to report on the European Commission,
[93]
remaining in the post until 1994.
[94]
A strong critic of the integrationist Commission president
Jacques Delors
, he established himself as one of the city's few
Eurosceptic
journalists.
[95]
He wrote articles about
euromyths
such as the EU wanting to ban
prawn cocktail
crisps and British sausages, and to standardise condom sizes because Italians had smaller penises.
[96]
He wrote that Brussels had recruited sniffers to ensure that Euro-manure smells the same,
[97]
and that the Eurocrats were about to dictate the acceptable curve of bananas
[c]
and the limits on the power of vacuum cleaners,
[99]
[d]
and to order women to return their old sex toys.
[97]
He wrote that euro notes made people impotent, that euro coins made people sick, and that a plan to blow up the
Berlaymont building
was in place because asbestos cladding made the building too dangerous to inhabit.
[97]
Many of his fellow journalists there were critical of his articles, opining they often contained lies designed to discredit the commission.
[102]
The Europhile Conservative politician
Chris Patten
later stated at that time Johnson was "one of the greatest exponents of fake journalism".
[94]
Johnson opposed banning handguns after the
Dunblane school massacre
, writing in his column "Nanny is confiscating their toys. It is like one of those vast
Indian programmes of compulsory vasectomy
."
[103]
Johnson's biographer,
Andrew Gimson
, believed these articles made him "one of [Euroscepticism's] most famous exponents".
[104]
According to another one of his biographers,
Sonia Purnell
, - who was Johnson's Brussels deputy
[94]
- he helped make Euroscepticism "an attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the Right", whereas it had been associated previously with the Left.
[105]
Johnson's articles established him as the favourite journalist of Conservative Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher
,
[106]
but Johnson annoyed her successor, the Europhile
John Major
, who spent a great deal of time attempting to refute what Johnson said.
[107]
Johnson's articles exacerbated tensions between the Conservative Party's Eurosceptic and Europhile factions. As a result, he earned the mistrust of many party members.
[108]
His writings were also a key influence on the emergence of the eurosceptic
UK Independence Party
(UKIP) in the early 1990s.
[105]
Conrad Black
, then proprietor of
The Daily Telegraph
, said Johnson "was such an effective correspondent for us in Brussels that he greatly influenced British opinion on this country's relations with Europe".
[109]
In February 1990, Johnson's wife Allegra left him; after several attempts at reconciliation, their marriage ended in April 1993.
[110]
[111]
He then entered a relationship with childhood friend
Marina Wheeler
, who had moved to Brussels in 1990.
[112]
They were married in May 1993 in Horsham, Sussex.
[113]
Soon after this Marina gave birth to a daughter.
[114]
Johnson and his new wife settled in
Islington
, North London,
[115]
an area known for its association with the left-liberal
intelligentsia
. Under the influence of this
milieu
and of his wife, Johnson moved in a more liberal direction on issues such as
climate change
,
LGBT rights
and race relations.
[116]
While in Islington, the couple had three more children, all given the surname Johnson-Wheeler.
[117]
They were sent to the local Canonbury Primary School and then to private secondary schools.
[118]
Devoting much time to his children, Johnson wrote a book of verse,
The Perils of the Pushy Parents: A Cautionary Tale
, which was published to largely poor reviews.
[119]
Political columnist: 1994-1999
Back in London, Hastings turned down Johnson's request to become a
war reporter
,
[120]
instead promoting him to the position of assistant editor and chief political columnist.
[121]
Johnson's column received praise for being ideologically eclectic and distinctively written, and earned him a Commentator of the Year Award at the
What the Papers Say
awards.
[122]
Some critics condemned his writing style as bigotry; in various columns he used the words "
piccaninnies
" and "
watermelon smiles
" when referring to Africans, championed European colonialism in Uganda
[123]
[124]
[125]
and referred to gay men as "tank-topped bumboys".
[126]
Contemplating a political career, in 1993, Johnson outlined his desire to stand as a Conservative candidate to be a
Member of the European Parliament
(MEP) in the
1994 European Parliament elections
.
Andrew Mitchell
convinced Major not to veto Johnson's candidacy, but Johnson could not find a constituency.
[127]
He subsequently turned his attention to obtaining a seat in the UK House of Commons. After being rejected as Conservative candidate for
Holborn and St. Pancras
, his party selected him the candidate for
Clwyd South
in north Wales, then a
Labour Party
safe seat
. Spending six weeks campaigning, he attained 9,091 votes (23 per cent) in the
1997 general election
, losing to the Labour candidate.
[128]
Scandal erupted in June 1995 when a recording of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend
Darius Guppy
was made public.
[129]
In the conversation, Guppy said that his criminal activities involving insurance fraud were being investigated by
News of the World
journalist Stuart Collier, and he asked Johnson to provide him with Collier's private address, seeking to have the latter beaten to the extent of "a couple of black eyes and a cracked rib or something like that". Johnson agreed to supply the information, although he expressed concern that he would be associated with the attack.
[129]
When the phone conversation was published in 1995, Johnson stated that ultimately he had not obliged Guppy's request. Hastings reprimanded Johnson but did not dismiss him.
[129]
Johnson was given a regular column in
The Spectator
, sister publication to
The Daily Telegraph
, which attracted mixed reviews and was often thought rushed.
[130]
In 1999, he was also given a column reviewing new cars in the magazine
GQ
.
[131]
His behaviour regularly disgruntled his editors; the large number of parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars frustrated
GQ
staff.
[126]
At
The Daily Telegraph
and
The Spectator
, he was consistently late delivering his copy, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; some related that if they published without his work included, he would get angry and shout at them with expletives.
[132]
Johnson's appearance on an April 1998 episode of the BBC's satirical current affairs show
Have I Got News for You
brought him national fame.
[133]
He was invited back on to later episodes, including as a guest presenter; for his 2003 appearance, Johnson received a nomination for the
BAFTA Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance
.
[134]
[135]
After these appearances, he came to be recognised on the street by the public, and was invited to appear on other television shows, such as
Top Gear
,
Parkinson
,
Breakfast with Frost
, and the political show
Question Time
.
[136]
The Spectator
and MP for Henley: 1999-2008
In July 1999, Conrad Black offered Johnson the editorship of
The Spectator
on the condition he abandon his parliamentary aspirations; Johnson agreed.
[137]
While retaining
The Spectator
'
s traditional right-wing bent, Johnson welcomed contributions from leftist writers and cartoonists.
[138]
Under Johnson's editorship, the magazine's circulation grew by 10% to 62,000 and it began to turn a profit.
[139]
His editorship also drew criticism; some opined that under him
The Spectator
avoided serious issues,
[140]
while colleagues became annoyed that he was regularly absent from the office, meetings, and events.
[141]
He gained a reputation as a poor political pundit because of incorrect political predictions made in the magazine.
[140]
His father-in-law
Charles Wheeler
and others strongly criticised him for allowing
Spectator
columnist
Taki Theodoracopulos
to publish racist and antisemitic language in the magazine.
[142]
[143]
Journalist Charlotte Edwardes wrote in
The Times
in 2019 alleging that Johnson had squeezed her thigh at a private lunch in the offices of the
Spectator
in 1999 and that another woman had told her he had done the same to her. A Downing Street spokesman denied the allegation.
[144]
[145]
In 2004, Johnson published an editorial in
The Spectator
after the murder of
Ken Bigley
suggesting that Liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status and also "hooked on grief" over the
Hillsborough disaster
, which Johnson partly blamed on "drunken fans".
[146]
[147]
In an appendix added to a later edition of his 2005 book about the Roman empire,
The Dream of Rome
,
Tell MAMA
and the
Muslim Council of Britain
strongly criticised Johnson for arguing
Islam
has caused the
Muslim world
to be "literally centuries behind" the West.
[148]
Becoming an MP
The selection of Boris Johnson ... confirms the Tory Party's increasing weakness for celebrity personalities over the dreary exigencies of politics. Johnson, for all his gifts, is unlikely to grace any future Tory cabinet. Indeed, he is not known for his excessive interest in serious policy matters, and it is hard to see him grubbing away at administrative detail as an obscure, hardworking junior minister for social security. To maintain his funny man reputation he will no doubt find himself refining his
Bertie Wooster
interpretation to the point where the impersonation becomes the man.
-Max Hastings,
London Evening Standard
,
[149]
Following
Michael Heseltine
's retirement, Johnson decided to stand as Conservative candidate for
Henley
, a Conservative safe seat in
Oxfordshire
.
[150]
The local Conservative branch selected him although it was split over Johnson's candidacy. Some thought him amusing and charming while others disliked his flippant attitude and perceived lack of knowledge of the local area.
[151]
Assisted by his television fame, Johnson won the seat in the
2001 general election
with a majority of 8,500 votes.
[152]
Alongside his Islington home, Johnson bought a farmhouse outside
Thame
in his new constituency.
[153]
He regularly attended Henley social events and occasionally wrote for the
Henley Standard
.
[154]
His constituency surgeries proved popular, and he joined local campaigns to stop the closure of
Townlands Hospital
and the local
air ambulance
.
[155]
In Parliament, Johnson was appointed to a
standing committee
assessing the
Proceeds of Crime Bill
, but missed many of its meetings.
[156]
Despite his credentials as a public speaker, his speeches in the House of Commons were widely deemed lacklustre; Johnson later called them "crap".
[157]
In his first four years as MP, he attended just over half of the Commons votes; in his second term, this declined to 45 per cent.
[158]
He usually supported the Conservative
party line
but rebelled against it five times in this period.
[159]
In
free votes
, he demonstrated a more socially liberal attitude than many colleagues, supporting the
Gender Recognition Act 2004
and the repeal of
Section 28
.
[160]
[161]
However, in 2001, Johnson had spoken out against plans to repeal Section 28, saying it was "Labour's appalling agenda, encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools".
[162]
[163]
After initially stating he would not, he
voted in support
of the government's plans to join the United States in the
2003 invasion of Iraq
,
[153]
and in April 2003 visited occupied Baghdad.
[164]
In August 2004, he backed unsuccessful
impeachment procedures
against Prime Minister
Tony Blair
for "
high crimes and misdemeanours
" regarding the war,
[165]
and in December 2006 described the invasion as "a colossal mistake and misadventure".
[166]
Although labelling Johnson "ineffably duplicitous" for breaking his promise not to become an MP, Black decided not to dismiss him because he "helped promote the magazine and raise its circulation".
[167]
Johnson remained editor of
The Spectator
, also writing columns for
The Daily Telegraph
and
GQ
, and making television appearances.
[168]
His 2001 book,
Friends, Voters, Countrymen: Jottings on the Stump
, recounted that year's election campaign,
[169]
while 2003's
Lend Me Your Ears
collected together previously published columns and articles.
[170]
In 2004,
HarperCollins
published his first novel:
Seventy-Two Virgins: A Comedy of Errors
revolved around the life of a Conservative MP and contained various autobiographical elements.
[171]
Responding to critics who argued he was juggling too many jobs, he cited
Winston Churchill
and
Benjamin Disraeli
as exemplars who combined their political and literary careers.
[172]
To manage the stress, he took up jogging and cycling,
[173]
and became so well known for the latter that Gimson suggested he was "perhaps the most famous cyclist in Britain".
[174]
Following
William Hague
's resignation as Conservative leader, Johnson backed
Kenneth Clarke
, regarding Clarke as the only candidate capable of winning a general election; the party elected
Iain Duncan Smith
.
[175]
Johnson had a strained relationship with Duncan Smith, and
The Spectator
became critical of his party leadership.
[176]
Duncan Smith was removed from his position in November 2003 and was succeeded by
Michael Howard
; Howard deemed Johnson to be the most popular Conservative politician with the electorate and appointed him vice-chairman of the party, responsible for overseeing its electoral campaign.
[177]
In his Shadow Cabinet reshuffle of May 2004, Howard appointed Johnson to the position of shadow arts minister.
[178]
In October, Howard ordered Johnson to apologise publicly in
Liverpool
for publishing a
Spectator
article - anonymously written by
Simon Heffer
- which said the crowds at the
Hillsborough disaster
had contributed towards the incident and that Liverpudlians had a predilection for reliance on the
welfare state
.
[179]
[180]
In November 2004, tabloids revealed that since 2000 Johnson had been having an affair with
Spectator
columnist
Petronella Wyatt
, resulting in two
abortions
. Johnson initially called the claims "an inverted pyramid of piffle".
[181]
After the allegations were proven, Howard asked Johnson to resign as vice-chairman and shadow arts minister for publicly lying; when Johnson refused, Howard dismissed him from those positions.
[182]
[183]
In July 2005,
Who's the Daddy?
, a play by
The Spectator
'
s theatre critics
Toby Young
and Lloyd Evans being performed at Islington's
King's Head Theatre
, satirised the scandal.
[184]
Second term
As Shadow Minister for Higher Education, Johnson visited various universities (as here at the
University of Nottingham
in 2006)
Johnson in 2007
At the
2005 general election
, Johnson was re-elected MP for Henley, increasing his majority to 12,793.
[185]
Labour won the election and Howard stood down as Conservative leader; Johnson backed
David Cameron
as his successor.
[186]
After Cameron was elected, he appointed Johnson as the shadow higher education minister, acknowledging his popularity among students.
[187]
Interested in streamlining university funding,
[188]
Johnson supported Labour's
proposed top-up fees
.
[189]
He campaigned in 2006 to become the
Rector of the University of Edinburgh
, but his support for top-up fees damaged his campaign, and he came third.
[190]
[191]
In April 2006, the
News of the World
alleged that Johnson was having an affair with the journalist Anna Fazackerley; the pair did not comment, and shortly afterwards Johnson began employing Fazackerley.
[192]
[193]
That month, he attracted further public attention for rugby-tackling former footballer
Maurizio Gaudino
in a charity football match.
[194]
In September 2006, Papua New Guinea's
High Commission
protested after he compared the Conservatives' frequently changing leadership to
cannibalism in the country
.
[195]
In 2005,
The Spectator
'
s new chief executive,
Andrew Neil
, dismissed Johnson as editor.
[196]
To make up for this loss of income, Johnson negotiated with
The Daily Telegraph
to raise his annual fee from £200,000 to £250,000, averaging at £5,000 per column, each of which took up around 90 minutes of his time.
[197]
[198]
He presented a
popular history
television show,
The Dream of Rome
, which was broadcast in January 2006; a book followed in February.
[199]
A sequel,
After Rome
, focused on early Islamic history.
[200]
As a result of his various activities, in 2007, he earned £540,000, making him the third-highest-earning MP that year.

Main article:
2008 London mayoral election
See also:
2007 London Conservative Party mayoral selection
In July 2007, Johnson announced his candidacy to be the Conservative candidate for
Mayor of London
in the 2008 mayoral election.
[202]
[203]
In September, he was selected after gaining 79 per cent of the vote in a public London-wide
primary
.
[204]
[205]
Johnson pledged to replace the city's
articulated buses
with
New Routemaster
buses if elected mayor
Johnson's mayoral campaign focused on reducing youth crime, making public transport safer, and replacing the
articulated buses
with an updated version of the
AEC Routemaster
.
[9]
Targeting the Conservative-leaning suburbs of
outer London
, it capitalised on perceptions that the Labour Mayoralty had neglected them in favour of
inner London
.
[206]
His campaign emphasised his popularity, even among those who opposed his policies,
[207]
with opponents complaining a common attitude among voters was: "I'm voting for Boris because he is a laugh."
[9]
The campaign of Labour incumbent
Ken Livingstone
portrayed Johnson as an out-of-touch
toff
and bigot, citing alleged racist and homophobic language used in his columns; Johnson responded these quotes had been taken out of context and were intended as satire.
[208]
In the election, Johnson received 43 per cent and Livingstone 37 per cent of first-preference votes; when second-preference votes were added, Johnson was victorious with 53 per cent to Livingstone's 47 per cent.
[209]
[210]
Johnson subsequently announced his intention to stand down as MP for Henley.
[211]
[212]
First term: 2008-2012
After Johnson became mayor, those in City Hall who were deemed too closely allied to Livingstone's administration had their employment terminated.
[213]
Johnson appointed
Tim Parker
to be first Deputy Mayor, but after Parker began taking increasing control at City Hall and insisted that all staff report directly to him, Johnson dismissed him.
[214]
Because of these issues, many in the Conservative Party initially distanced themselves from Johnson's administration, fearing it would be counterproductive to achieving a Conservative victory at the
2010 general election
.
[215]
Johnson gave a victory speech in
City Hall
after being elected as the
Mayor of London
During the electoral campaign, Johnson had confided to
Brian Paddick
he was unsure how he would maintain his lifestyle while relying upon the mayoral salary of £140,000 a year.
[216]
To resolve this problem, he agreed to continue his
Daily Telegraph
column alongside his mayoral job, thus earning a further £250,000 a year.
[217]
His team believed this would cause controversy and made him promise to donate a fifth of his
Daily Telegraph
fee to a charitable cause providing bursaries for students. Johnson resented this, and ultimately did not pay a full fifth.
[218]
Controversy erupted when he was questioned about his
Daily Telegraph
fee on
BBC
's
HARDtalk
; there, he referred to the £250,000 salary as "chicken feed", something that was widely condemned, given that this was then approximately 10 times the average yearly wage for a British worker.
[219]
[220]
[221]
Johnson at the opening of NASDAQ in 2009
During his first administration, Johnson was embroiled in several personal scandals. After moving to a new house in Islington, he built a shed on his balcony without obtaining
planning permission
; after neighbours complained, he dismantled it.
[222]
The press also accused him of having an affair with Helen Macintyre and of fathering her child, allegations that he did not deny.
[223]
[224]
[225]
[226]
Controversy arose when Johnson was accused of warning the MP
Damian Green
that police were planning to arrest him; Johnson denied the claims and did not face criminal charges under the
Criminal Justice Act
.
[227]
He was accused of
cronyism
,
[228]
in particular for appointing
Veronica Wadley
, a former
Evening Standard
editor who had supported him, as the chair of London's
Arts Council
when she was widely regarded as not being the best candidate for the position.
[229]
[230]
[231]
He was implicated in the
parliamentary expenses scandal
, being accused of excessive expenses claims for taxis. His deputy mayor
Ian Clement
was found to have misused a City Hall credit card, resulting in his resignation.
[232]
Johnson remained a popular figure in London with a strong celebrity status.
[233]
In 2009, he rescued
Franny Armstrong
from anti-social teenagers who had threatened her while he was cycling past them.
[234]
[235]
[236]
Policies
The
New Routemaster
bus introduced by Johnson's administration
Johnson made no major changes to the mayoral system Livingstone developed.
[237]
He reversed several measures implemented by Livingstone's administration, ending the city's oil deal with Venezuela, abolishing
The Londoner
newsletter, and scrapping the half-yearly inspections of
black cabs
, which was reinstated three years later.
[238]
Abolishing the western wing of the
congestion charging
zone,
[239]
he cancelled plans to increase the congestion charge for
four-wheel-drive vehicles
.
[240]
He was subsequently accused of failing to publish an independent report on air pollution commissioned by the
Greater London Authority
, which revealed the city breached legal limits on
nitrogen dioxide
levels.
[241]
[242]
Johnson retained Livingstone projects such as
Crossrail
and the
2012 Olympic Games
, but was accused of trying to take credit for them.
[243]
He introduced a public bicycle scheme that had been mooted by Livingstone's administration; colloquially known as "
Boris Bikes
", the part privately financed system cost £140 million and was a significant financial loss but proved popular.
[244]
[245]
Despite Johnson's support of cycling in London, and his much-publicised identity as a cyclist, some cycling groups who argued he had failed to make the city's roads safer for cyclists criticised his administration.
[246]
As per his election pledge, he commissioned the development of the
New Routemaster
buses for central London.
[247]
He also ordered the construction of a
cable car system
that crossed the
River Thames
between
Greenwich Peninsula
and the
Royal Docks
.
[248]
Johnson implemented Livingstone's idea of a public bicycle system; the result was dubbed the
"Boris Bike"
.
Johnson's first policy initiative was a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport.
[249]
[250]
At the beginning of his tenure as mayor, Johnson announced plans to extend pay-as-you-go
Oyster cards
to national rail services in London.
[251]
A pledge in Johnson's election manifesto was to retain Tube ticket offices, in opposition to Livingstone's proposal to close up to 40 London Underground ticket offices.
[252]
On 2 July 2008, the Mayor's office announced the closure plan was to be abandoned and that offices would remain open.
[253]
On 21 November 2013,
Transport for London
announced that all London Underground ticket offices would close by 2015.
[254]
In financing these projects, Johnson's administration borrowed £100 million,
[255]
while public transport fares were increased by 50 per cent.
[256]
During his first Mayoral term, Johnson was perceived as having moved leftward on certain issues, for instance, supporting the
London Living Wage
and endorsing an amnesty for illegal migrants.
[257]
He tried placating critics who had deemed him a bigot by appearing at
London's gay pride parade
and praising ethnic minority newspapers.
[258]
In 2012, he banned London buses from displaying the adverts of
Core Issues Trust
, a Christian group, which compared homosexuality to an illness.
[259]
In August 2008, Johnson broke from the traditional protocol of those in public office not publicly commenting on other nations' elections by endorsing
Barack Obama
for the
presidency of the United States
.
[260]
[261]
Relations with police, finance, and the media
Johnson's response to the 2011 London riots was criticised
Johnson appointed himself chair of the
Metropolitan Police Authority
(MPA), and in October 2008 successfully pushed for the resignation of Metropolitan Police Commissioner
Ian Blair
after the latter was criticised for allegedly handing contracts to friends and for his handling of the
death of Jean Charles de Menezes
.
[262]
[263]
[264]
This earned Johnson great respect among Conservatives, who interpreted it as his first act of strength.
[265]
Johnson resigned as MPA chairman in January 2010,
[257]
but throughout his mayoralty was highly supportive of the Metropolitan Police, particularly during the controversy surrounding the
death of Ian Tomlinson
.
[266]
Overall crime in London fell during his administration, but his claim that serious youth crime had decreased proved to be false, and he acknowledged the error.
[267]
[268]
Similarly, his claim that Metropolitan Police numbers had increased was characterised as untrue,
[267]
but the fact-checkers at
Full Fact
felt that both Johnson's and his critics' positions are defensible.
[269]
He was criticised for his response to the
2011 London riots
; holidaying with his family in
British Columbia
when the rioting broke out, he did not return immediately to London, only doing so 48 hours after it had begun and addressing Londoners 60 hours thereafter. Upon visiting shopkeepers and residents affected by the riots in
Clapham
, elements within the crowds booed and jeered him.
[270]
Johnson lights the flame at the 2010
London Youth Games
opening ceremony
Johnson championed London's financial sector and denounced what he saw as "banker bashing" following the
financial crisis of 2007-08
,
[271]
condemning the
anti-capitalist
Occupy London
movement that appeared in 2011.
[272]
He spent much time with those involved in the financial services and criticised the government's 50p tax rate for higher earners.
[273]
He collected donations from the city's wealthy for a charitable enterprise, the Mayor's Fund, which he had established to aid disadvantaged youths. It initially announced the fund would raise £100 million, but by 2010 it had only spent £1.5 million.
[274]
He also maintained extensive personal contacts throughout the British media,
[275]
which resulted in widespread favourable press coverage of his administration.
[275]
In turn he remained largely supportive of his friends in the media - among them
Rupert Murdoch
- during the
News International phone hacking scandal
.
[276]
The formation of the Forensic Audit Panel was announced on 8 May 2008. The panel was tasked with monitoring and investigating financial management at the
London Development Agency
and the
Greater London Authority
.
[277]
Johnson's announcement was criticised by Labour for the perceived politicisation of this nominally independent panel, who asked whether the appointment of key Johnson allies to the panel - "to dig dirt on Ken Livingstone" - was "an appropriate use of public funds".
[278]
The head of the panel,
Patience Wheatcroft
, was married to a Conservative councillor
[279]
and three of the four remaining panel members also had close links to the Conservatives:
Stephen Greenhalgh
(Conservative Leader of
Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council
),
[280]
Patrick Frederick (Chairman of Conservative Business Relations for South East England and Southern London), and Edward Lister (Conservative Leader of
Wandsworth London Borough Council
).
[281]
Re-election campaign
Up for re-election in 2012, Johnson again hired Crosby to orchestrate his campaign.
[282]
Before the election, Johnson published
Johnson's Life of London
, a work of popular history that the historian
A. N. Wilson
characterised as a "coded plea" for votes.
[283]
Polls suggested that while Livingstone's approach to transport was preferred, voters in London placed greater trust in Johnson over issues of crime and the economy.
[284]
During the
2012 Mayoral election
, Johnson sought re-election, while Livingstone was selected as the Labour candidate again. Johnson's campaign emphasised the accusation that Livingstone was guilty of
tax evasion
, for which Livingstone called Johnson a "bare-faced liar".
[285]
The political scientist Andrew Crines believed that Livingstone's campaign focused on criticising Johnson rather than presenting an alternate and progressive vision of London's future.
[286]
In 2012, Johnson was
re-elected
as mayor.
[287]
Second term: 2012-2016
Johnson at the
2012 Summer Olympics
London was successful in its bid to host the
2012 Summer Olympics
while Ken Livingstone was still mayor in 2005. Johnson's role in the proceedings was as the co-chair of an Olympic board which oversaw the games.
[288]
Two of his actions after taking on this role were to improve transportation around London by making more tickets available and laying on more buses around the capital during the busy period, when thousands of spectators were temporary visitors in London.
[289]
[290]
Johnson was accused of covering up pollution ahead of the games by deploying dust suppressants to remove air particulates near monitoring stations.
[241]
In November 2013, Johnson announced major changes to the operation of
London Underground
, including the extension of operating hours to run through the night at weekends. All staffed ticket offices would be closed to save over £40 million a year and replaced with automated ticketing systems.
[291]
[292]
Johnson had a close friendship with American technology entrepreneur, former DJ
[293]
and model
Jennifer Arcuri
, with
The Sunday Times
describing him as a regular visitor to her flat,
[294]
and implying they were in a sexual relationship.
[295]
In 2013, a mayoral fund awarded her company, Innotech, £10,000, followed the next year by Arcuri being awarded £15,000 from a government programme. Johnson intervened to allow her onto three trade mission trips.
[296]
The Sunday Times
said in September 2019 that Johnson failed to declare his personal relationship as a conflict of interest.
[297]
Later that month, the Greater London Authority referred Johnson and his actions in the matter to the
Independent Office for Police Conduct
(IOPC) "so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office". The IOPC was involved because the Mayor is also London's
police and crime commissioner
.
[298]
The
London Assembly
began its own investigation but paused it at the IOPC's request to avoid overlap. On 9 November 2019 it was revealed that the IOPC, which had been due to publish a report on its investigation, had decided to do so after the general election of 12 December.
[299]
The IOPC issued its report in May 2020, concluding that, although there was no basis for any criminal charge, there was evidence that the close relationship between Johnson and Arcuri had influenced decisions by officials. The report found Johnson should have declared an interest concerning Arcuri and that his failure to do this could have breached the London Assembly's code of conduct. On behalf of the London Assembly, the chair of its Greater London Authority Oversight Committee said the committee would now resume its own investigation.
[300]
In 2015, Johnson criticised then-presidential candidate
Donald Trump
's false comments that there were
no-go zones in London
governed by
shariah
and inaccessible for non-Muslims. Johnson said Trump was "betraying a quite stupefying ignorance that makes him, frankly, unfit to hold the office of president of the United States",
[301]
becoming the first senior politician in the UK to declare Trump unfit for office, but rejecting calls for him to be banned from the country.
[302]
Johnson added that he "would invite [Trump] to come and see the whole of London and take him round the city - except I wouldn't want to expose Londoners to any unnecessary risk of meeting Donald Trump".
[301]
He later called Trump's comments "ill informed" and "complete and utter nonsense", adding that "the only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump".
[303]
In 2016, he said he was "genuinely worried that he could become president", telling ITV's
Tom Bradby
of one moment where he was mistaken for Trump in New York as "one of the worst moments" of his life.
[304]
Johnson did not run for a third term for Mayor of London and stepped down on 5 May 2016 following
the election
of former transport minister,
Sadiq Khan
. A
YouGov
poll commissioned at the end of Johnson's term revealed that 52% of Londoners believed he did a "good job" as Mayor of London while 29% believed he did a "bad job".
[305]
In 2016, Sadiq Khan announced that three German-made water cannon, which Johnson had bought for the
Metropolitan Police
without waiting for clearance from the then-Home Secretary
Theresa May
, were to be sold, with the proceeds going to youth services.
[306]
The vehicles proved unsellable and were eventually sold for scrap in 2018 at a £300,000 loss.
[307]
Return to Parliament
Johnson initially said that he would not return to the House of Commons while remaining mayor.
[233]
After much media speculation, in August 2014 he sought selection as the Conservative candidate for the
safe seat
of
Uxbridge and South Ruislip
at the
2015 general election
,
[308]
becoming the party's candidate in September.
[309]
[310]
In the
2015 general election
, Johnson was elected MP. There was much speculation that he had returned to Parliament because he wanted to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister.
[311]
Brexit campaign: 2015-2016
Main article:
Vote Leave
In February 2016, Johnson endorsed
Vote Leave
in the "Out" campaign for the
2016 European Union membership referendum
.
[312]
He called Cameron's warnings about leaving "greatly over exaggerated". Following this announcement, which was interpreted by financial markets as making Brexit more probable, the
pound sterling
slumped by nearly 2% against the US dollar, reaching its lowest level since March 2009.
[313]
In April 2016, in an article for
The Sun
, in response to a comment by President
Barack Obama
that Britain should remain in the European Union, Johnson said an "ancestral dislike" of Britain owing to his "part-Kenyan" background may have shaped Obama's views.
[314]
Conservative MP Sir
Nicholas Soames
branded the comments "idiotic" and "deeply offensive".
[315]
Several Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians condemned them as racist and unacceptable.
[316]
[317]
In light of the remark, a
King's College London
student society revoked a speaking invitation it had extended to him.
[318]
Conversely, former Conservative Party leader
Iain Duncan Smith
and
UK Independence Party
(UKIP) leader
Nigel Farage
defended his comments.
[316]
[319]
Johnson supported Vote Leave's statement that the government was committed to
Turkish accession to the EU
at the earliest possible opportunity, contradicting the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign's view that Turkey "is not an issue in this referendum and it shouldn't be". Vote Leave was accused of implying that 80 million Turks would come to the UK if it stayed in the EU. When interviewed in January 2019, he said he had not mentioned Turkey during the campaign.
[320]
[321]
On 22 June 2016, Johnson declared 23 June could be "Britain's independence day" in a televised debate in front of a 6,000-member audience at
Wembley Arena
.
[322]
David Cameron
, British prime minister at the time, specifically addressed Johnson's claim, publicly stating, "the idea that our country isn't independent is nonsense. This whole debate demonstrates our sovereignty."
[323]
Following the victory of the "Leave" campaign, Cameron resigned as Conservative leader and prime minister. Johnson was widely regarded as the front-runner to succeed him.
[324]
[325]
Johnson announced he would not stand in the
Conservative leadership election
.
[326]
Shortly before this, Michael Gove, hitherto a Johnson ally, concluded that Johnson "cannot provide the leadership or build the team for the task ahead".
[327]
[328]
The Daily Telegraph
called Gove's comments "the most spectacular political assassination in a generation".
[329]
Johnson endorsed
Andrea Leadsom
's candidature, but she dropped out of the race a week later, leaving Theresa May to be elected uncontested.
[330]
Foreign Secretary: 2016-2018
Main article:
Boris Johnson's tenure as Foreign Secretary
Official portrait of Johnson as Foreign Secretary
After May had become Conservative Party leader and prime minister, she appointed Johnson
Foreign Secretary
in July 2016.
[331]
Analysts saw the appointment as a tactic to weaken Johnson politically: the new positions of "
Brexit secretary
" and
international trade secretary
left the foreign secretary as a figurehead with few powers.
[331]
[332]
Johnson's appointment ensured he would often be out of the country and unable to organise and mobilise backbenchers against her, while forcing him to take responsibility for problems caused by withdrawing from the EU.
[333]
[334]
Some journalists and foreign politicians criticised Johnson's appointment because of his history of controversial statements about other countries.
[335]
[336]
[337]
His tenure in the role attracted criticism from diplomats and foreign policy experts.
[338]
[339]
A number of diplomats, FCO staff and foreign ministers who worked with Johnson compared his leadership unfavourably to previous foreign secretaries for his perceived lack of conviction or substantive positions on British foreign policy issues.
[338]
[339]
Former Swedish prime minister
Carl Bildt
said: "I wish it was a joke."
[340]
A senior official in Obama's government suggested Johnson's appointment would push the US further towards
Germany
at the expense of the
Special Relationship
with the UK.
[341]
On one occasion Egyptian president
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi
walked out of a meeting with Johnson after a meeting did not "get beyond the pleasantries".
[338]
Johnson with US president
Donald Trump
in 2017
UNGA
Johnson's visit to Turkey from 25 to 27 September 2016 was somewhat tense because he had won
Douglas Murray
's offensive poetry competition about the President of Turkey,
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
, four months earlier.
[342]
When questioned by a journalist whether he would apologise for the poem, Johnson dismissed the matter as "trivia".
[343]
Johnson pledged to help
Turkey join the EU
and expressed support for Erdogan's government.
[344]
Johnson supported the
Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
and refused to block UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
[345]
stating there was no clear evidence of breaches of international humanitarian law by Saudi Arabia in the
war in Yemen
.
[346]
In September 2016, human rights groups accused him of blocking the UN inquiry into Saudi war crimes in Yemen.
[347]
Given the UK-Saudi alliance, in December 2016, he attracted attention for commenting the Saudis were akin to the Iranians in "puppeteering and playing
proxy wars
" throughout the Middle East.
[348]
[349]
[350]
May said his comments did not represent the government's view.
[351]
In November 2017, Johnson told the
Foreign Affairs Select Committee
that
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe
- a British-Iranian dual citizen serving a five-year prison sentence in Iran after being arrested for training citizen journalists and bloggers in a
BBC World Service Trust
project - had been "simply teaching people journalism". Zaghari-Ratcliffe had said that her visit had been made simply for her daughter to meet her grandparents. Facing criticism, Johnson stated he had been misquoted and that nothing he said had justified Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence.
[352]
[353]
In May 2018, Johnson backed
[354]
[355]
the
Iran nuclear deal framework
, despite Donald Trump's withdrawal.
[356]
Johnson said the deal brought economic benefits to the Iranian people.
[357]
Johnson described the
Gülen movement
as a "cult" and supported
Turkey's post-coup purges
. He said that
Turkey's coup attempt
"was deeply violent, deeply anti-democratic, deeply sinister and it was totally right that it was crushed".
[358]
Johnson visiting the
British Virgin Islands
after
Hurricane Irma
In April 2017, Johnson said that
Gibraltar's sovereignty
was "not going to change" after Brexit.
[359]
Johnson promised while in
Northern Ireland
that Brexit would leave the Irish border "absolutely unchanged".
[360]
In May 2017, during the
2017 United Kingdom general election
, a woman criticised him for discussing ending tariffs on Indian whisky in a
Sikh temple
in Bristol (
Sikhism prohibits alcohol use
). He later expressed regret that the protester held differing views to his on alcohol.
[361]
Johnson visited the islands of
Anguilla
, and
Tortola
(in the
British Virgin Islands
) on 13 September 2017 to confirm the United Kingdom's commitment to helping restore British territories devastated by
Hurricane Irma
.
[362]
He said he was reminded of photos of
Hiroshima
after the
atom bomb
had landed on it.
[363]
In September 2017, he was criticised for reciting lines from
Rudyard Kipling
's poem
Mandalay
while visiting a
Myanmar
temple; the British ambassador, who was with him, suggested it was "not appropriate".
[364]
[365]
[366]
In October 2017, he faced criticism for stating the Libyan city of
Sirte
could become an economic success like
Dubai
: "all they have to do is clear the dead bodies away".
[367]
[368]
Johnson did not condemn the actions of the Spanish government and police during the outlawed
Catalan independence referendum
on 1 October 2017.
[369]
Initially favouring a less hostile approach to Russia,
[370]
Johnson soon backed a more aggressive policy towards Russia.
[371]
[372]
Following the March 2018
poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal
in
Salisbury
, an act which the UK government blamed on Russia,
[373]
[374]
Johnson compared
Vladimir Putin
's hosting of the
World Cup in Russia
to
Adolf Hitler
's hosting of the
Olympic Games in Berlin
in 1936.
[375]
Russia's Foreign Ministry denounced Johnson's "unacceptable and unworthy" parallel towards Russia, a "nation that
lost millions of lives
in fighting Nazism".
[376]
Johnson described the
Nord Stream 2
gas pipeline from Russia to Germany as "divisive" and a "threat" that left Europe dependent on a "malign Russia" for its
energy supplies
.
[377]
Johnson condemned the
persecution
of
Rohingya Muslims
in Myanmar,
[378]
comparing the situation with the
displacement of Palestinians
in 1948.
[379]
Johnson supported the
Turkish invasion of northern Syria
aimed at ousting the
Syrian Kurds
from the enclave of
Afrin
.
[380]
Johnson meeting with Iranian foreign minister
Mohammad Javad Zarif
in Tehran in December 2017
In a September 2017 op-ed, Johnson reiterated the UK would regain control of £350m a week after Brexit, suggesting it go to the
National Health Service
(NHS).
[381]
Cabinet colleagues subsequently criticised him for reviving the assertion and accused of "clear misuse of official statistics" by the chair of the
UK Statistics Authority
,
Sir David Norgrove
.
[382]
[383]
The authority rejected the suggestion that it was quibbling over newspaper headlines and not Johnson's actual words.
[383]
Following the
2017 general election
, Johnson denied media reports he intended to challenge May's leadership.
[384]
In a February 2018 letter to May, Johnson suggested that Northern Ireland may have to accept border controls after Brexit and that it would not seriously affect trade, having initially said a hard border would be unthinkable.
[385]
In March 2018, Johnson apologised for his "inadvertent sexism" after being criticised for calling Shadow Foreign Secretary
Emily Thornberry
as "Lady Nugee"; Thornberry was married to
Christopher Nugee
but did not use his surname.
[386]
In June, he was reported as having said "fuck business" when asked about corporate concerns regarding a 'hard' Brexit.
[387]
[388]
[389]
[390]
Johnson said that
US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital
is a "moment of opportunity" for peace.
[391]
In June 2018, Johnson accused the
UNHRC
of focusing disproportionately on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict
and Israel's
occupation
of the
Palestinian territories
.
[392]
Johnson with former prime minister
Gordon Brown
in May 2018
Secret recordings obtained by
BuzzFeed News
in June 2018 revealed Johnson's dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiating style, accusing her of being too collaborative with the European Union in Brexit negotiations. Comparing May's approach to that of the US president Donald Trump - who at the time was engaged in a combative trade war with the EU because it raised tariffs on metal - Johnson said: "Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He'd go in bloody hard ... There'd be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he'd gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It's a very, very good thought." He also called
Philip Hammond
and the Treasury "the heart of Remain" and accused individuals of scaremongering over a Brexit "meltdown", saying "No panic.
Pro bono publico
, no bloody panic. It's going to be all right in the end."
[393]
During trips to the United States as foreign secretary, Johnson had repeated meetings with Trump adviser and speechwriter
Stephen Miller
, which were held off White House grounds and kept quiet from May. During the meetings, Miller and Johnson "swapped speech-writing ideas and tips".
[394]
In April 2018, Johnson travelled to Italy to attend a party at the
Palazzo Terranova
, an Umbrian villa owned by the former
KGB
agent
Alexander Lebedev
and hosted by his son
Evgeny
. He travelled without security protection or other officials, as Johnson stated to the Liaison Committee in July 2022,
[395]
and did not document the trip, which led to accusations of Johnson having misled parliament over his attendance of the party.
[396]
In June 2023, it was revealed that Lord Simon McDonald, the most senior civil servant of his department, was not aware of the trip either. Johnson defended himself against criticism he received after details about the trip became public by stated that "no government business was discussed" at the event as far as he was aware.
[397]
[398]
Lebedev's villa was monitored by the Italian secret service at the time, who, according to a
Channel 4
documentary, suspected it to be used for espionage activities.
[399]
Johnson granted a peerage to Alexander Lebedev's son
Evgeny
in 2020. The appointment was done against the advice of the
MI6
, and met with criticism over potential security concerns it posed.
[400]
[401]
[402]
In July 2018, three days after the
cabinet
had its meeting at
Chequers
to agree on a
Brexit strategy
,
[403]
Johnson, along with Brexit Secretary
David Davis
,
[404]
resigned his post.
[405]
Return to the backbenches: 2018-2019
By resigning as foreign secretary, Johnson returned to the role of a
backbench MP
. In July, he delivered a resignation speech, stating that ministers were "saying one thing to the EU about what we are really doing, and pretending another to the electorate". Johnson added that "it is not too late to save Brexit. We have time in these negotiations. We have changed tack once and we can change once again".
[406]
Buzzfeed
reported Johnson had been in contact with
Steve Bannon
,
Donald Trump
's former chief adviser. In interviews, Bannon had praised Johnson and said he should challenge Theresa May for the party leadership.
[407]
[408]
In January 2019, Johnson came under criticism for remarks he had made during the 2016 Leave campaign regarding the prospect of Turkish accession to the European Union; he denied making such remarks.
[409]
In March 2019, Johnson said that expenditure on investigating historic allegations of child abuse, instead of more police on the streets, was money "spaffed up the wall".
[410]
A victim, anti-abuse organisations, a police chief and Shadow police minister
Louise Haigh
strongly criticised this.
[411]
Journalism
In July 2018, Johnson signed a 12‑month contract to write articles for the
Telegraph Media Group
.
[412]
In August, the
Advisory Committee on Business Appointments
(ACoBA) reported that this employment was a breach of the
Ministerial Code
.
[412]
[413]
In December, Johnson was ordered to apologise to Parliament for failing to declare £50,000 of earnings. The
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
found the errors were not inadvertent, and that Johnson had failed on nine occasions to make declarations within the rules.
[414]
In September 2018, Johnson wrote: "We have opened ourselves to perpetual political blackmail. We have wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution - and handed the detonator to
Michel Barnier
." Senior Tories heavily criticised him, with
Alan Duncan
of the Foreign Office vowing to ensure the comments marked "the political end of Boris Johnson".
[415]
[416]
In April 2019, the
Independent Press Standards Organisation
ruled that a claim in a 6 January 2019 article in
The Daily Telegraph
, "The British people won't be scared into backing a woeful Brexit deal nobody voted for", authored by Johnson,
[417]
that a no-deal
Brexit
was "by some margin preferred by the British public" was false, and "represented a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article in breach of Clause 1 (i)" of its guidelines, and required that a correction to the false claim be published in the print edition, and appended to the online version.
[418]
2019 Conservative Party leadership election
Main article:
2019 Conservative Party leadership election
The logo used by Johnson's leadership campaign in 2019
On 16 May 2019, Johnson confirmed he would stand in the forthcoming
Conservative Party leadership election
following
Theresa May
's anticipated resignation.
[419]
On 7 June, Johnson formally launched his campaign, saying, "we must leave the EU on 31 October. We must do better than the current Withdrawal Agreement that has been rejected three times by Parliament—and let me clear that I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome. I don't think that we will end up with any such thing. But it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously for no deal."
[420]
On the campaign trail, Johnson warned of "catastrophic consequences for voter trust in politics" if the government pushed the EU for further delays. He advocated removing the
backstop
from any Brexit deal and replacing it with alternative arrangements. On 25 and 26 August, he announced plans to retain £7 or £9 billion of the £39 billion divorce payment the UK is due to transfer to the EU upon withdrawal.
[421]
[422]
Johnson initially pledged to cut income tax for earners of more than £50,000 by raising the 40% tax threshold to £80,000, but backed away from this plan in June 2019 after coming under criticism in a televised
BBC
debate.
[423]
He also said he planned to raise the level at which low-paid workers start to pay
National Insurance
.
[424]
A poll of party members published on 13 June showed Johnson to be the clear front-runner.
[425]
He received 114 votes in the first ballot of party MPs,
[426]
126 in the next, 143 votes in the third and 157 in the fourth. In the last ballot, on 20 June, he reached 160 votes and was named one of the final two candidates, alongside Jeremy Hunt.
[427]
The members' vote closed on 22 July. The following day, Johnson was elected leader with 92,153 votes (66%) to Hunt's 46,656 (34%).

Boris Johnson: First Speech as Prime Minister
On 24 July 2019, the day following Johnson's election as Conservative Party leader, Queen
Elizabeth II
accepted
Theresa May
's resignation and appointed Johnson as prime minister. This made Johnson the second prime minister to be born outside the British Isles, after fellow Conservative
Bonar Law
, and the first to be born outside
British territories
.
[429]
Johnson appointed
Dominic Cummings
, whom he worked with on the Vote Leave campaign, as his senior advisor.
[430]
Brexit policy

Emmanuel Macron
in Paris
Johnson signing the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement
In his
first speech as PM
, Johnson said that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on 31 October 2019 with or
without a deal
, and promised to remove the
Irish backstop
from the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
[431]
[432]
Johnson declared his intention to
re-open negotiations
on the withdrawal agreement, but talks did not immediately resume as the EU refused to accept Johnson's pre-condition that the backstop be removed.
[433]
The government subsequently announced £2.1bn of funding to prepare for a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.
[434]
On 28 August 2019, UK and EU negotiators agreed to resume regular meetings to discuss the withdrawal agreement.
[435]
Also on 28 August 2019, Johnson declared he had asked the Queen to
prorogue Parliament
from 10 September, narrowing the window in which Parliament could block a no-deal Brexit and causing a
political controversy
.
[436]
The Queen at
Privy Council
approved prorogation later the same day, and it began on 10 September, scheduled to last until 14 October.
[437]
Some suggested
[438]
that this prorogation amounted to a
self-coup
, and on 31 August 2019, protests occurred in towns and cities throughout the United Kingdom.
[439]
[440]
As of 2 September 2019, three separate court cases challenging Johnson's action were in progress or scheduled to take place,
[441]
and on 11 September, three Scottish judges ruled the prorogation of the UK Parliament to be unlawful.
[442]
[443]
On 12 September, Johnson denied lying to the Queen over suspension of the Parliament, while a Belfast Court rejected claims that his Brexit plans will have a negative impact on Northern Ireland's peace policy.
[444]
On 24 September, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Johnson's advice to prorogue Parliament was unlawful, and therefore the prorogation was rendered null and of no effect.
[445]
[446]
When Parliament resumed on 3 September 2019, Johnson indicated he would call a general election under the
Fixed-term Parliaments Act
after opposition and rebel Conservative MPs successfully voted against the government to take control of the order of business to prevent a no-deal exit.
[447]
Despite government opposition, the
Benn Act
, a bill to block a no-deal exit, passed the Commons on 4 September 2019, causing Johnson to propose a general election on 15 October.
[448]
His motion was unsuccessful as it failed to command the support of two-thirds of the House.
[449]
In October 2019, following bilateral talks between Johnson and
Taoiseach
Leo Varadkar
,
[450]
the UK and EU agreed to a
revised deal
, which
replaced the backstop
with a new
Northern Ireland Protocol
.
[451]
First Cabinet

Johnson
appointed
his
Cabinet
on 24 July 2019,
[452]
dismissing 11 senior ministers and accepting the resignation of six others.
[453]
[454]
The mass dismissal was the most extensive postwar Cabinet reorganisation without a change in the ruling party.
[455]
[456]
Among other appointments, Johnson made
Dominic Raab
the
First Secretary of State
and foreign secretary, and appointed
Sajid Javid
and
Priti Patel
as the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
and
Home Secretary
, respectively.
Loss of working majority
On 3 September 2019,
Phillip Lee
crossed the floor
to the
Liberal Democrats
following a disagreement with Johnson's
Brexit
policy. This left the government without a
working majority
in the House of Commons.
[457]
Later that day,
21 Conservative MPs
, including the
Father of the House
and former Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke
, and another former Chancellor
Philip Hammond
, had the party
whip
withdrawn for defying party orders and supporting an opposition motion.
[458]
(The whip was restored to 10 former Conservative ministers on 29 October.
[459]
)
Johnson giving a speech in December 2019 after the
2019 general election
On 5 September 2019, Johnson's brother

resigned from the government and announced that he would step down as MP, describing his position as "torn between family and national interest".
[460]
Two days later,
Amber Rudd
resigned as
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
and from the Conservative Party, describing the withdrawal of the party whip from the MPs as an "assault on decency and democracy".

In October 2019, Parliament was dissolved, and an election called for 12 December. The election resulted in the Conservative Party winning 43.6% of the vote and a parliamentary landslide majority of 80 seats - its biggest since
1987
under
Margaret Thatcher
.

devolved government.
[465]
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Sajid Javid
resigned from the Cabinet after refusing a demand from Johnson and

in June 2021 following the resignation of

Johnson conducted another reshuffle of his cabinet in September 2021. Changes included the dismissal of
Education Secretary
Gavin Williamson
who had received significant criticism for his handling of disruption to education, such as the
2020 exam grading controversy
, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Johnson delivering a press conference on
COVID-19
, 31 July 2020
The
COVID-19 pandemic
emerged as a serious crisis within the first few months of Johnson's second term.
[469]
Throughout the pandemic, Johnson made a number of policy decisions to curb the pandemic some time after the
Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE)
advised them, and contradicting his previous pledges and statements.
[470]
[471]
[472]
[473]
Johnson's non-attendance of five
COBR
briefings during the early months of the pandemic and the failure of the UK government to prepare for and control the outbreak has been criticised.
[474]
[475]
[476]
The UK was amongst the last major
[
clarification needed
]
European states to close schools, ban public events and order a
lockdown
.
[477]
[478]
This response is thought by some scientists to have contributed to the UK's high death toll from COVID-19, which as of January 2021
was among the highest in the world in total and by population.
[479]
[
needs update
]
Reuters
reported that scientists were critical of Johnson both for acting too slowly to stop the spread of COVID-19 and for mishandling the government's response measures,
[480]
and
Politico
quoted
Chief Medical Officer
Chris Whitty
as saying that an earlier initial lockdown would have significantly lowered the death toll.
[481]
The
BMJ
published several editorials critical of the policies adopted during the country's public health response.
[482]
[483]
Johnson's public communication over the virus and the UK's test and trace system were also criticised.
[480]
[484]
[485]
On 3 March 2020, Johnson claimed to have shaken hands with COVID-19 patients in hospital on the same day that SAGE had advised the government to warn the public not to shake hands and minimise physical contact,
[486]
[487]
though it was unclear whether the hospital he visited actually contained any coronavirus patients.
[488]
He continued to shake hands publicly in the following days including on 5 March and 9 March.
[489]
On 20 March, Johnson requested the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms, entertainment venues, museums and galleries that evening, though with some regret, saying, "We're taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub."
[490]
[491]
On 23 March, this was strengthened into a
COVID-19 lockdown
throughout the UK, except for a few limited purposes, backed up by
new legal powers
.
[492]
Johnson giving a speech in April 2020 after recovering from
COVID-19
On 27 March, it was announced that Johnson had tested positive for
COVID-19
.
[493]
On 5 April, with his symptoms persisting, he was admitted to a hospital for tests.
[494]
The next day, his condition having worsened, he was moved to the hospital's intensive care unit;
[495]
[496]
Dominic Raab
was appointed to deputise for him.
[496]
Johnson left intensive care on 9 April,
[497]
and left hospital three days later to recuperate at
Chequers
.
[498]
After a fortnight at Chequers, he returned to Downing Street on 26 April and was said to be chairing a government COVID-19 "
war cabinet
" meeting.
[499]
Johnson later said that he had been given
emergency oxygen
while in intensive care, and that doctors had made preparations in case of the event of his death.
[500]
A
scandal
in May 2020 involved Johnson's chief political advisor
Dominic Cummings
, who made a trip with his family to
Durham
during the March 2020 lockdown while experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Both Cummings and Johnson rejected widespread calls that Cummings resign.
[501]
[502]
[503]
Calls for Johnson to dismiss Cummings came from MPs both within and outside the Conservative Party. Johnson's defence of Cummings and his refusal to sack him caused a widespread backlash.
[504]
This resulted in a loss of confidence in the government and specifically its response to the pandemic, referred to as 'the Cummings effect' in a study in
The Lancet
. Concerns were raised in the study that this could affect the public's compliance with pandemic restrictions.
[505]
[506]
The Johnson ministry was
accused of cronyism in their assignment of contracts
related to the pandemic response. Procurement of government contracts for key COVID-19 supplies and measures became less transparent as a result of emergency measures which have bypassed the usual competitive tendering process.
[507]
[11]
In October 2020, Johnson conceded that the UK's
test and trace
system and its specially developed
contact tracing app
, which had been criticised for their cost and operational issues, had caused "frustrations" and needed improvement.
[480]

Johnson hosts virtual G7 meeting in February 2021
Johnson reportedly resisted calls from SAGE and within the government to enact a second lockdown throughout September as COVID-19 infections rose.
[472]
[510]
In April 2021, Johnson denied allegations he had said he would rather "
let the bodies pile high in their thousands
" than enact a second national lockdown on 30 October 2020.
[511]
[512]
[513]
The government enacted a second national lockdown on 31 October.
[471]
Throughout December 2020, COVID-19 cases across the UK rose significantly, putting additional strain on emergency services and hospitals
[514]
[515]
as the
Alpha variant
spread widely.
[516]
In response, the government enacted further restrictions to large parts of southern and eastern England and on 21 December shortened a planned household mixing period over Christmas.
[517]
After Russia began the world's first
COVID-19 vaccination
programme on 5 December 2020,
[518]
Britain began
its programme
three days later.
[519]
NHS workers successfully ensured that half of UK adults had received at least their first vaccine dose by 20 March 2021.
[520]
A third lockdown for the whole of England was introduced on 6 January 2021.
[521]
Record numbers of infections and daily deaths were recorded in the UK throughout January, and the government began exploring quarantine procedures on arrival.
[522]
Johnson said he was "deeply sorry" and "take[s] full responsibility" as the UK passed 100,000 deaths from COVID-19, the first European country to do so, on 26 January.
[523]
Johnson with US president
Joe Biden
at the
G7 summit
in Cornwall, 10 June 2021
In July 2021, Johnson announced that most generalised public health restrictions in England would be lifted and replaced by recommendations. This took place despite an increase in cases driven by the
Delta variant
.
[524]
[525]
In September 2021, Johnson was pictured in a cabinet meeting, with "at least 30 people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder", without anyone wearing masks and with all windows apparently closed, contradicting government advice.
[526]
Johnson was also photographed without a face mask during a visit to a hospital in November, although images showed that he did wear a mask at some points during his visit.
[527]
In December 2021, more stringent restrictions for England were put forward by Johnson and the government. The restrictions, called "Plan B", were a partial renewal of previous measures due to the increased incidence of the
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant
. These proposals included face coverings to be required in more public settings, guidance to
work from home
wherever possible, and requirements of
COVID-19 passports
to enter a nightclub or other large venues.
[528]
The government experienced the largest rebellion of Conservative MPs during Johnson's premiership, in opposition to these measures.
[529]
[530]
Legislative agenda
At the
State Opening of Parliament on 11 May 2021
, a range of proposed laws were announced that were expected to be enacted during Johnson's second term. These measures include the
Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Bill
, which would restore the
royal prerogative
to dissolve Parliament; a
Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill
to combat
deplatforming
at universities;
[531]
an
Online Safety Bill
that would impose a statutory
duty of care
on online companies and empower
Ofcom
to block particular websites;
[532]
and an
Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill
that would legally recognise animal sentience. Further laws would introduce
mandatory voter identification
at general elections, reform the national immigration system, and implement a
levelling up policy
to reduce imbalances between areas.

2021 Downing Street refurbishment controversy
Further information:
2021 Downing Street refurbishment controversy
In April 2021, Cummings made allegations that Johnson had arranged for donors to "secretly pay" for renovations on the private residence at 11 Downing Street.
[533]
Cummings wrote on his blog that the plans were "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal" and "almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended."
[534]
[535]
On 27 April Johnson asked the Cabinet Secretary,
Simon Case
, to hold a review about the refurbishment.
[536]
On 28 April, the
Electoral Commission
announced it had opened a formal investigation into the allegations.
[537]
[538]
On the same day Johnson said that he had not broken any laws over the refurbishment and had met the requirements he was obliged to meet in full.

During
Prime Minister's Questions
, the leader of the opposition,
Keir Starmer
, asked: "Who
initially
paid for the redecoration of his Downing Street flat?"; Johnson responded: "I paid for Downing Street's refurbishment personally."
[540]
On 28 May
Lord Geidt
published a report on the allegations in an annexe to the
register of interests
. The report concluded that Johnson did not breach the Ministerial Code and that no conflict, or reasonably perceived conflict, of interest arose. However, Lord Geidt expressed that it was "unwise" for Johnson to have proceeded with refurbishments without "more rigorous regard for how this would be funded".
[541]
[542]
Angela Rayner
, Deputy Leader of the
Labour Party
, wrote to Lord Geidt asking for evidence of the lack of conflict of interest and said that it was "frankly scarcely believable" that Johnson did not know who was funding the refurbishments.
[543]
[544]
The Electoral Commission reported on 9 December that it found that the Conservative Party had failed to follow the law in not accurately reporting donations to the party from Lord Brownlow and imposed a £17,800 fine on the party.
[545]
[546]
The Herald
said the commission's report outlined how, in March, all the money paid by Brownlow and his company had been reimbursed, as had the payments made by the Conservative Party and Cabinet Office.
[546]
Downing Street had said at the time that the full cost of the works had been met personally by the prime minister.
[546]
Owen Paterson controversy

Owen Paterson § Lobbying and breach of Commons advocacy rules
, and
United Kingdom parliamentary second jobs controversy
In November 2021, Johnson backed a motion to block the suspension of
Owen Paterson
, a Conservative MP found to have abused his position by the
independent standards commissioner
after undertaking paid lobbying on behalf of two companies.
[547]
The motion called for the creation of a new Conservative-majority committee to examine reforms of the standards investigation process.
[548]
Many Conservative MPs refused to support the motion, and 13 defied a
three-line whip
to vote against it.
[549]
Following the announcement by opposition parties that they would boycott the new committee, and faced with a backlash in the media and from MPs of all parties, the government reversed its position and announced that a new vote would take place on whether Paterson should be suspended.
[550]
Paterson announced his resignation as an MP the same day.
[551]
After Paterson resigned, a
by-election
was held in Paterson's former constituency of
North Shropshire
. The
Liberal Democrat
candidate,
Helen Morgan
, overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 23,000 to win the seat.
[552]
The 34% swing was
seventh largest in United Kingdom by-election history
.

Partygate scandal
Main article:
Partygate
Downing Street, where some of the gatherings took place
[554]
In early December 2021, reports emerged that
social gatherings of government and Conservative Party staff
in Downing Street had taken place ahead of Christmas 2020 against COVID-19 regulations. Johnson and a spokesperson denied these allegations.
[555]
[556]
Following a leaked video showing Downing Street staff joking about a "fictional party", at a press conference rehearsal recorded days after one alleged party took place, Johnson apologised for the contents of the video and suggested he had been misled but had now ordered an inquiry into whether a party took place and whether rules were broken.
[557]
[558]
On 10 January 2022,
ITV News
reported that a planned party had taken place on 20 May 2020, during the first lockdown. ITV had obtained an email sent by principal private secretary
Martin Reynolds
to staff inviting them to "socially distanced drinks" in the garden of No. 10 and asking them to "bring your own booze".
[559]
At the time, people outdoors were not allowed to meet more than one person from outside their household.
[560]
Two eyewitnesses later alleged that Johnson and Symonds attended, contradicting Johnson's insistence in December 2021 that there were "no parties".
[561]
[559]
At first, Johnson did not deny that he attended.
[562]
On 12 January 2022, Johnson apologised to MPs in the Commons for "attending an event in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown",
[563]
[564]
stating he believed it was "a work event".
[565]
He said that MPs should await the outcome of the independent inquiry into Westminster lockdown parties, led by senior civil servant
Sue Gray
, which he said "will report as soon as possible".
[566]
There were immediate calls across the House for Johnson to resign, voiced mainly by the leaders of the opposition parties. Later, Scottish Conservative leader
Douglas Ross
and several other Conservative MPs expressed their agreement.
[566]

Sue Gray's report

On 19 January,
Bury South
MP
Christian Wakeford
defected from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party.
[568]
At the end of Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative former minister
David Davis
called for Johnson to resign, quoting
Leo Amery
calling on
Neville Chamberlain
to resign during the
Norway Debate
in 1940, and saying: "You have sat there too long for all the good you have done. In the name of God, go."
[569]
[570]
[571]
Amery's call was itself a reference to Cromwell's dismissal of the
Rump parliament
.
On 25 January, the
Metropolitan Police
's chief commander,
Cressida Dick
, announced that they were commencing investigations into the Downing Street Parties. Dick stated that "potential breaches of COVID-19 regulations" at Downing Street and
Whitehall
over the last two years would be looked into.
[572]
An abbreviated version of the
Sue Gray report
into the controversy was released on 31 January, where Gray concluded there was a "failure of leadership" over the events that she had examined. The release of the full report was delayed pending the Metropolitan Police's investigation.
[573]
In early February 2022, four of Johnson's senior aides resigned:
Dan Rosenfield
(chief of staff),
Martin Reynolds
(principal private secretary),
Munira Mirza
(head of policy) and
Jack Doyle
(director of communications).
[574]
In April 2022, Johnson was issued a
fixed penalty notice
for £50, as police determined that he committed a criminal offence in breaching COVID-19 regulations by attending parties during COVID-19 restrictions.
[575]
[576]
At least 50 such notices would be issued, with other recipients including Johnson's wife and Chancellor Sunak. Johnson therefore became the first prime minister in British history to have been sanctioned for breaking the law while in office.
[577]
Boris Johnson either knowingly broke the law or did not understand laws he himself had introduced.
[554]
A total of 83 people received fixed penalty notices related to Partygate gatherings.
[578]
According to Downing Street insiders, Johnson was involved in instigating a party on the occasion of
Lee Cain
leaving Number 10. What had begun as press office drinks became a party after Johnson arrived, gave a speech and poured drinks for staff.
Labour
's deputy leader,
Angela Rayner
said, "If the latest reports are true, it would mean that not only did the prime minister attend parties, but he had a hand in instigating at least one of them. He has deliberately misled the British people at every turn. The prime minister has demeaned his office."
[579]
[580]
[581]
[582]
On 19 April 2022, Commons Speaker
Lindsay Hoyle
decided that MPs would vote, on 21 April, on whether Johnson should be referred to the
Parliamentary Privileges Committee
to investigate whether he knowingly misled Parliament.
[583]
This was waved through unopposed on 21 April.
[584]
Steve Baker
said Johnson's "marvellous contrition... only lasted as long as it took to get out of the headmaster's study". Baker added, "I have to acknowledge that if the prime minister occupied any other office of senior responsibility... he would be long gone."
[585]
The Guardian
reported that leaflets for the
May 2022 local elections
referred to candidates as local Conservatives and avoided pictures of Johnson.
[586]
Following the elections, many leading Conservatives in areas where the Conservatives had done badly were blaming Johnson and calling on Johnson to resign.
[587]
On 1 June,
Lord Geidt
said he wanted Johnson to explain why he thought his fixed penalty notice did not show he had broken the ministerial code.
[588]
On 6 June,
Graham Brady
announced that the threshold for a vote on Johnson's leadership had been passed; the vote was scheduled for later that same day.
[589]
On 3 March 2023, an interim report from the
Commons Select Committee of Privileges
said there was evidence that "strongly suggests" breaches of coronavirus regulations would have been "obvious" to Johnson.
[590]
The report also said "There is evidence that those who were advising Mr Johnson about what to say to the press and in the House were themselves struggling to contend that some gatherings were within the rules".
[590]
Johnson said none of the evidence showed he "knowingly" misled Parliament, and added that "it is clear from this report that I have not committed any contempt of Parliament".
[590]
The report stated that the Commons may have been misled on multiple occasions and Johnson "did not correct the statements [at the] earliest opportunity", as an MP would be expected to do.
[590]
The committee also stated that Johnson had "personal knowledge" over lockdown gatherings in No 10, which he could have disclosed to MPs.
[590]
Starmer slur controversy
While speaking in the House of Commons on 31 January 2022, Johnson falsely blamed Starmer for the non-prosecution of serial sex offender
Jimmy Savile
when Starmer was
Director of Public Prosecutions
(DPP) in the
Crown Prosecution Service
(CPS). Starmer was DPP in the years immediately prior to Savile's death but there is no evidence he was involved in the decision to not have him prosecuted.
[591]
The claim linking the failure of the CPS to prosecute Savile to Starmer originated in 2018 on the right-wing
Guido Fawkes
blog.
[592]
Johnson received criticism for the comment and his policy adviser,
Munira Mirza
, resigned three days later, saying in her resignation letter that Johnson had made "a scurrilous accusation" against Starmer.
[593]
Julian Smith
, the former chief
whip
, and
Simon Hoare
were among Conservatives who called for Johnson to apologise. On 3 February, during an interview with
Sky News
, Johnson defended his comments, stating that in 2013, Starmer apologised because the CPS had not investigated Savile; however, Johnson then said: "I totally understand that he [Starmer] had nothing to do personally with those decisions".
[594]
Vote of confidence
Main article:
2022 vote of confidence in the Conservative Party leadership of Boris Johnson
In the week prior to and throughout the
Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II
in June 2022, it had been speculated that a vote of confidence in Johnson's leadership of the Conservative Party might occur in the near future.
[595]
[596]
On 6 June 2022, the Conservative Party announced that Johnson would face a vote of confidence in his leadership of the party, after at least 54 Conservative MPs wrote no-confidence letters to Sir
Graham Brady
, the chairman of the
1922 Committee
, meeting the threshold required to arrange such a vote. Johnson won the vote, with 211 in favour and 148 against (59% in favour, 41% against).
[597]
[598]
The number of rebel MPs was larger than had been expected.
[598]
The vote showed more widespread lack of confidence in Johnson than similar votes during the leadership of Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May.
[598]
The result was described by Keir Starmer as the "beginning of the end" for Johnson's premiership.
[599]
June 2022 by-elections
Following heavy Conservative defeats in the 23 June 2022 by-elections in
Wakefield
by the Labour Party and in
Tiverton and Honiton
, by the Liberal Democrats, former party leader Michael Howard called for Johnson to resign, saying: "[Mr Johnson's] biggest asset has always been his ability to win votes but I'm afraid yesterday's results make it clear that he no longer has that ability."
[600]
[601]
Oliver Dowden
, the Co-
Chairman of the Conservative Party
, resigned saying: "We cannot carry on with business as usual"
[602]
[603]
and "Somebody must take responsibility".
[604]
Johnson announced that had no intention of changing or resigning; senior Conservatives accused him of increasingly "delusional" behaviour.
[605]
[606]
On 26 June 2022 Johnson said: "At the moment I'm thinking actively about the third term and what could happen then, but I will review that when I get to it." He also claimed that he intended to stay as prime minister until the mid-2030s, although Number 10 later said that he had been joking.
[607]
Pincher scandal
Main article:
Chris Pincher scandal
Government Deputy Chief Whip
Chris Pincher
resigned on 30 June 2022, saying he had "drunk far too much" the night before at the
Carlton Club
, a private members' club, in
St James's
, London, and having "embarrassed myself and other people".
[608]
It was later alleged that he sexually assaulted two men,
[609]
and he was suspended as a Conservative MP.
[610]
On 3 July 2022 six new allegations against Pincher emerged, involving behaviour over a decade.
[611]
Johnson allegedly referred to Pincher as "handsy" and Cummings said Johnson joked about him being "Pincher by name, pincher by nature" in 2020, leading to calls for Johnson to explain how much he knew about Pincher's behaviour.
[612]
Ministers initially said that Johnson was unaware of any specific complaints against Pincher when he was appointed as deputy chief whip. The BBC then reported, however, that an official complaint and subsequent investigation into Pincher, while he was at the Foreign Office (July 2019 to February 2020), had confirmed his misconduct, and that Johnson had been made aware of the matter at that time.
[613]
Sir
Simon McDonald
, former
Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
, later said that the prime minister had been briefed "in person" about Pincher.
[614]
[615]
Mass resignations
Main article:
July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis
On 5 July 2022, Sunak and Javid resigned within minutes of each other,
[616]
followed over the next 24 hours by 11 other ministers, as well as Conservative MPs from
Parliamentary Private Secretary
and other Government positions, including the
Solicitor General
,
Alex Chalk
;
[617]
other
backbenchers
also withdrew their support for Johnson. Many of the MPs involved stated that the Pincher affair had led them to change their minds on the suitability of Johnson to hold the office of prime minister.
[618]
It was further reported on 6 July that Johnson could face another confidence vote, with members of the 1922 Committee considering changing the rules as soon as that evening to allow this to happen.
[619]
By 4 p.m. on 6 July, there had been a total of 31 resignations.
[620]
As of May 2022, the government comprised 122 ministers.
[621]
Announcement of resignation
Johnson announcing his pending resignation as
Leader of the Conservative Party
By the morning of 7 July, the newly installed
Chancellor of the Exchequer
,
Nadhim Zahawi
, publicly stated his belief that Johnson should resign. Within hours, the BBC and other news outlets reported Boris Johnson's intention to resign as prime minister, pending a
party leadership election
by autumn 2022. Johnson announced his resignation at 12.30 pm.
[622]
[623]
[624]
Upon reports of his resignation, the
pound sterling
temporarily strengthened in value, and UK stocks rose.
[625]
He remained as prime minister until September, while the Conservative Party chose a new leader.
[626]
During his final Prime Minister's Questions Johnson signed off by saying "
hasta la vista, baby
".
[627]
On 5 September 2022, it was announced that
Liz Truss
had won the
Conservative leadership election
. She became prime minister the next day, after formally being appointed by Queen Elizabeth II at
Balmoral Castle
.
[628]
[629]
During his farewell speech outside 10 Downing Street on 6 September 2022 Johnson referred to the Roman statesman
Cincinnatus
. Some commentators noted that, while, as Johnson said, Cincinnatus returned to his plough, he was also later recalled to power.
[630]
Environmental policies
In November 2020, Johnson announced a 10-point plan for a "green industrial revolution", which would include an end to the sale of petrol and
diesel
cars and vans by 2030,
[e]
quadruple the amount of
offshore wind power
capacity within a decade, fund a variety of emissions-cutting proposals, and spurn a proposed
green post-COVID-19 recovery
.
[632]
In 2021, the UK government under Johnson's leadership announced plans to cut
carbon emissions
by 78% by 2035.
[633]
Johnson announced that the UK would join the Global Methane Pledge to cut
methane emissions
by 30% by the year of 2030 at the
COP26
summit, which the UK hosted.
[634]
[635]
Before the summit, representatives of
Greenpeace
and
Friends of the Earth
criticised Johnson's comments on plans to introduce "enforceable limits" on carbon emissions for other countries, which they accused of being unsubstantive
[636]
and his government faced criticism from environmental groups for cutting taxes on domestic air travel, given the
environmental impact of aviation
.
[637]
In April 2022, Johnson announced that eight more
nuclear reactors
would be built on existing
nuclear power plant
sites, and called for an expansion in wind energy.
[638]
Under these plans, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from
low-carbon power
sources by 2030.

Hong Kong and China
Johnson said in July 2019 that his government would be very "pro-China" in an interview with the Hong Kong broadcaster
Phoenix TV
. He voiced support for Chinese president
Xi Jinping
's infrastructure investment effort, the
Belt and Road Initiative
, and promised to keep the United Kingdom "the most open economy in Europe" for
Chinese investment
.
[645]
On 3 June 2020, Johnson announced that if China were to continue pursuing the
Hong Kong national security law
, the UK would offer 350,000
Hong Kong residents
who are
British National (Overseas) passport
holders, and 2.6 million other eligible individuals, the chance to move to the UK, with the possibility of later applying for citizenship.
[646]
China accused the UK of interfering in its internal affairs.
[647]
Johnson declined to describe the Chinese government's
treatment of the Uyghur people
as "genocide", despite use of the term by the United States.
[648]
Johnson's government argued that genocide should be decided by the International Criminal Court.
[649]
Nevertheless, he called what is happening to the
Uyghurs
in Xinjiang as "utterly abhorrent".
[648]
The UK joined the
AUKUS
defence pact with the United States and Australia in September 2021, which was interpreted as aiming to counter Chinese power in the
Indo-Pacific
region. The pact was denounced by China
[650]
and caused a French backlash, as it usurped existing
plans for Australia to procure French submarines
.
[651]
Afghanistan
On 8 July 2021, the day after saying he was "apprehensive" about the future of Afghanistan following what was then the impending withdrawal of US troops, whilst announcing the near completion of British troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Johnson expressed the view that there was "no military path to victory for the
Taliban
".
[652]
[653]
A few weeks later, following the
fall of Kabul to the Taliban
, he blamed the United States for the crisis caused by the
withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan
,
[654]
[655]
saying that
NATO
alliance members "could not continue this US-led mission, a mission conceived and executed in support of America, without American logistics, without US air power and without American might".
[656]
UK-EU trade negotiation
Main articles:
Trade deal negotiation between the UK and EU
and
EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
Following the formal
withdrawal from the European Union
in January 2020, Johnson's government entered
trade negotiations with the EU
to agree on their future relationship before the end of the
transition period
on 31 December 2020.
[657]
Fisheries was a major topic
of the negotiations.
[657]
[658]
On 16 October 2020 Johnson said that the UK "must get ready" for no trade deal with the EU.
[659]
With negotiations continuing until days before the deadline, it was announced on 24 December 2020 that a trade deal had been agreed.
[660]
Entitled the
EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement
, it came into force provisionally on 1 January 2021, and formally on 1 May. A
fisheries dispute between the UK and France
occurred shortly afterwards. Introduction of new UK border checks were delayed until 2022 to minimise the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
[657]
In May 2022, Johnson readied a draft that would unilaterally change parts of the
Northern Ireland Protocol
, citing issues with medical supplies and cuts in VAT. One of the thornier points of contention involves safety regulations for food and plants, an area where the British government is opposed to a closer alignment with existing EU regulations. For its part, the EU has so far rebuffed the idea of changing the text of the treaty to accommodate the British. A unilateral override by the UK would be tantamount to a breach of the agreement. As Johnson sought a more conciliatory tone, sources within the government began to stress that the draft is designed to be an "insurance policy" and in any case would take years to become law.
[661]
Russia and Ukraine
Johnson walks on a street of war-hit
Kyiv
along with
President of Ukraine
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
on 10 April 2022
In November 2021, Johnson warned that the European Union faces "a choice" between "sticking up for Ukraine" and approving the
Nord Stream 2
natural gas pipeline which runs from Russia to Europe.
[662]
During the
2021-2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis
, Johnson's government warned the Russian Government not to invade
Donbas
.
[663]
[664]
[665]
Despite this, Johnson's
Foreign Secretary
Liz Truss
told
BBC News
that British troops were "unlikely" to be deployed.
[666]
In a phone call to President
Vladimir Putin
, Johnson urged him to "avoid bloodshed".
[667]
Johnson and Putin agreed in a phone call to work towards a "peaceful resolution".
[668]
On 1 February 2022, Johnson arrived in
Kyiv
on a diplomatic visit.
[669]
He called the presence of the
Russian Armed Forces
near the
Russia-Ukraine border
"the biggest security crisis that Europe has faced for decades".
[670]
The Kremlin denied that it wanted to attack Ukraine.
[670]
On 14 February 2022, Johnson warned an invasion of Ukraine could take place within 48 hours.
[671]
On 20 February 2022, Johnson warned that Russia is planning the "biggest war in Europe since
1945
" as Putin intends to invade and encircle the capital of
Kyiv
.
[672]
On 21 February 2022, Johnson condemned
Russia's diplomatic recognition
of two
self-proclaimed
separatist
republics in
Donbas
.
[673]
Johnson condemned the
2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine
, and ensured the UK joined in
international sanctions
on Russian banks and
oligarchs
.
[674]
He later announced the UK would phase out
Russian oil
by the end of 2022.
[675]
On 9 April 2022, Johnson travelled to Kyiv and met the
President of Ukraine
,
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
.
[676]
On 16 April 2022, Russia's
Ministry for Foreign Affairs
banned Johnson and a number of senior British politicians, including cabinet members, from visiting Russia, saying that Britain aimed to isolate Russia politically and supply "the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of NATO".
[677]
Within Ukraine, Johnson is praised by many as a supporter of anti-Russian sanctions and
military aid for Ukraine
.
[678]
The defence secretary
Ben Wallace
said on 25 April that the UK had provided £200m in military aid to Ukraine.
[679]
On 3 May, Johnson
virtually addressed
the
Ukrainian Parliament
, becoming the first world leader to speak in Ukraine since the invasion. In his speech, he pledged an extra £300m in military aid to Ukraine, praised Ukraine's resistance to Russia as its "finest hour" and said that the West had been "too slow to grasp what was actually happening" prior to Russia's invasion.
[680]
[681]
In July 2022, Johnson warned that it would be a mistake to cease fire and
freeze the conflict
because that is exactly what Putin wanted.
[682]
In August 2022, Johnson blamed Vladimir Putin for the emerging
global energy crisis
, saying that Putin wanted the UK to "buckle" in the face of "eye-watering" energy price rises.
[683]
Post-premiership (2022-present)
Johnson with U.S. Representative
John Rose
in 2023
After stepping down as party leader, Johnson reverted to being an ordinary backbench MP.
[684]
[685]
Following the
death of Queen Elizabeth II
, Johnson took part in
Charles III
's
Accession Council
, and many other funeral-related events.
[686]
[687]
[688]
As a former prime minister, Johnson, with his wife Carrie, attended Elizabeth II's
state funeral
on 19 September 2022.
After
Liz Truss
announced her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 20 October 2022, Johnson sought support from MPs to run in the subsequent
leadership election
, and received support from several cabinet members.
[689]
Three days later, he announced that he would not stand, stating that he would not have enough support from MPs to govern effectively,
[690]
[691]
even though it has been confirmed that he did receive more than the 100 nominations required to stand in a ballot against
Rishi Sunak
.
[692]
In January 2023, a
Savanta ComRes
poll for
The Independent
found 63% of voters did not want Johnson to return as prime minister. 58% believed Johnson should give up his seat in Parliament if the
Commons Privileges Committee investigation
found he lied over Partygate.
In May 2023, Johnson was referred to the police by the Cabinet Office regarding previously unknown potential breaches of COVID regulations that occurred between June 2020 and May 2021,
[693]
to which Johnson's office issued a statement criticising the "unfounded suggestions" which "has all the hallmarks of yet another politically motivated stitch-up".
[693]
Johnson subsequently decided to stop relying on legal advice from government lawyers and began to look for independent legal advice.
[694]
On 9 June 2023, the publication of his
2022 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours
led to a public feud with Rishi Sunak.
[695]
[696]
Johnson supporter
Nadine Dorries
announced that she was resigning as an MP due to not being included as a peer on the published honours list.
[697]
The same day, after receiving a confidential report from a committee of the
House of Commons
that was looking into whether he had lied to Parliament over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson announced his resignation as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. This was following his reselection as a candidate for his seat in March 2023.
[698]
His resignation statement accused the Committee of bias and said he is "not alone in thinking that there is a witch-hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result".
[699]
Johnson's reaction was labelled as "Trumpian" by some of his former Conservative allies.
[700]
[701]
[702]
[703]
His resignation became effective on 12 June when the
Chancellor of the Exchequer
appointed Johnson
Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern
, a procedural device which allows an
MP to resign from the House of Commons
.
[704]
Within 24 hours, fellow MP
Nigel Adams
also resigned from the House of Commons.
[705]
On 15 June, the Commons Privileges Committee published their report, which concluded that Johnson lied to and deliberately misled the House of Commons over Partygate, misled the Committee themselves during the hearing, and acted in contempt of the Committee itself through a "campaign of abuse and intimidation".
[706]
The report noted that had Johnson still been a Member of Parliament, the Committee would have recommended he be suspended from Parliament for 90 days (for context, the
Recall of MPs Act 2015
provides for a recall of a Member for suspensions of ten or more sitting days). The Committee also recommended Johnson be denied a Parliamentary pass, a courtesy normally extended to former MPs.
[707]
[708]
The contents of the report represented a recommendation to the House of Commons, requiring a vote which was scheduled for 19 June. The Conservative Party issued a
one line whip
for the vote, essentially giving permission for their MPs to be elsewhere and avoid voting on the report.
[709]
Parliament accepted the report by 354 votes to seven - the seven votes all from Conservative MPs, with no votes recorded for 225 Conservative MPs, who either abstained or didn't turn up for the vote.
[710]
[711]
On 16 June, Johnson was unveiled by the
Daily Mail
as a new
columnist
for the newspaper, where he would write every Saturday. The news website
Politico Europe
reported that, according to one of their sources, Johnson would be paid a "very-high six-figure sum" to write the column.
[712]
[713]
Johnson reportedly informed
Acoba
, Whitehall's anti-corruption panel, half an hour before the columnist assignment was publicly announced. The committee ruled that Johnson committed a "clear breach" of the rules since he had not sought its advice on the matter within an appropriate timeframe.
[714]
[715]
Johnson had previously breached the same rules when he started writing for
The Telegraph
after stepping down as foreign secretary in 2018.
[716]
[717]
On 27 June, after looking into Johnson's breach, the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments told the government that the ministerial code needs reform.
[718]
On 21 July 2023, experts recovered all relevant messages from Johnson's phone which were to be handed over unredacted to the Coronavirus inquiry.
[719]
In September 2023, Johnson visited Ukraine, where he met with President
Zelensky
and also accepted the highest honorary title of
Doctor Honoris Causa
from
Lviv National University
.
[720]
In October 2023, Johnson announced he would join the television channel
GB News
as a presenter, commentator and programme maker for the upcoming
General Election
and
US Presidential Election
.

Political positions and ideology
Main article:
Political positions of Boris Johnson

John Hemming
(left) and Conservative MP
Graham Stuart
(centre) in March 2006
[I am] free-market, tolerant, broadly libertarian (though perhaps not ultra-libertarian), inclined to see the merit of traditions, anti-regulation, pro-immigrant, pro-standing on your own two feet, pro-alcohol, pro-hunting, pro-motorist and ready to defend to the death the right of
Glenn Hoddle to believe in reincarnation
.
— Boris Johnson, 2011
[156]
Ideologically, Johnson has been described by himself and others as a "
One-Nation Tory
".
[723]
[724]
Political scientists have described Johnson's political positions as ambiguous and contradictory, encompassing
nativist
, authoritarian and
free market
tendencies on the one hand, and one-nation
liberal conservatism
on the other.
[725]
Some scholars have questioned Johnson's commitment to one-nation conservativism, instead characterising his ideology as being flexible and populist.
[726]
[727]
Purnell stated that Johnson regularly changed his opinion on political issues, commenting on what she perceived to be "an ideological emptiness beneath the staunch Tory exterior".
[728]
She later referred to his "opportunistic - some might say pragmatic - approach to politics".
[17]
During his tenure as London Mayor, Johnson gained a reputation as "a liberal, centre-ground politician", according to
Business Insider
.
[729]
In 2012, the political scientist
Tony Travers
described Johnson as "a fairly classic—that is, small-state—mildly
eurosceptic
Conservative" who, like his contemporaries Cameron and
George Osborne
, also embraced "modern social liberalism".
[730]
The Guardian
stated that while mayor, Johnson blended economic and social liberalism,
[731]
with
The Economist
saying that in doing so Johnson "transcends his Tory identity" and adopts a more libertarian perspective.
[732]
According to political scientist Richard Hayton, Johnson's premiership centred around Brexit, which served as a "national cause". Johnson evoked the discourse of
popular sovereignty
and
anti-establishment
populism to portray Parliament as seeking to "sabotage" Brexit, and in doing so, presented himself "as the true representative of 'the people'".
[725]
[733]
In 2019,
Al Jazeera
editor James Brownswell said that although Johnson had "leaned to the right" since the Brexit campaign, he remained "slightly more socially liberal" than much of his party.
[734]
Scholars of
comparative politics
have drawn comparisons between Johnson and other populist leaders such as Donald Trump and
Viktor Orban
.
[733]
Some commentators have likened aspects of Johnson's political style to
Trumpism
,
[735]
[736]
[737]
although others have argued against this, saying that Johnson's stance on matters such as social policy, immigration and free trade is liberal.
[738]
Johnson biographer Gimson wrote that Johnson is economically and socially "a genuine liberal", although he retains a "Tory element" to his personality through his "love of existing institutions, and a recognition of the inevitability of hierarchy".
[739]
Stuart Reid, Johnson's colleague at
The Spectator
, described the latter's views as being those of a "liberal libertarian".
[740]
In 2019, reacting to reports in
The Sun
, that Johnson had told cabinet colleagues he was "basically a Brexity Hezza", former deputy leader of the Conservative Party
Michael Heseltine
said Johnson "has no right to call himself a one-nation Conservative" and wrote: "I fear that any traces of liberal conservatism that still exist within the prime minister have long since been captured by the rightwing, foreigner-bashing, inward-looking view of the world that has come to characterise his fellow Brexiters."
[741]
Environment
Johnson spoke about climate action at the
COP26 climate summit
in Glasgow on 1 November 2021
During his period as mayor, Johnson expressed
climate sceptical
views in several columns.
[742]
[743]
[744]
In two
Daily Telegraph
columns published in 2012 and 2013, he conflated the distinction between weather and climate and highlighted a factually incorrect claim by weather forecaster and conspiracy theorist
Piers Corbyn
that reduced solar activity could lead to a "mini-Ice Age".
[745]
[744]
Bloomberg News
suggested that Johnson's interest in climate change increased after becoming prime minister, and suggested this could have been influenced by his wife
Carrie Symonds
and father
Stanley Johnson
, who are both environmental campaigners.
[746]
In 2019 and 2020, Johnson expressed support for the UK to have
"net-zero" greenhouse gas emissions
by 2050
[747]
and spoke about increasing ambition for mitigating climate change through
carbon capture and storage
[748]
and a
renewable energy transition
.
[749]
During the
2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference
, Johnson called for greater efforts towards
climate change mitigation
,
[750]
and welcomed the prospect of
coal phase-out
.
[751]
It was reported in 2022 that Johnson was convinced of the
scientific consensus on climate change
following a briefing by the chief scientist of the
Met Office
in January 2020, and subsequently made the issue a priority for his government.
[742]
According to
TheyWorkForYou
as of 2022
, Johnson has "generally voted against" what it described as "key measures to prevent
climate change
"
[

while an MP,
[752]
and other sources confirm this.
[745]
[743]
Immigration and the European Union
Johnson with EU Commission president
Jean-Claude Juncker
, 16 September 2019
Purnell believed it was the influence of Johnson's maternal family, the left-wing Fawcetts, that led to him developing "a genuine abhorrence of racial discrimination".
[753]
In 2003, Johnson said of the EU, "I am not by any means an ultra-
Eurosceptic
. In some ways, I am a bit of a fan of the
European Union
. If we did not have one, we would invent something like it."
[754]
As Mayor of London, Johnson was known as a supporter of
immigration
.
[754]
From 2009, he advocated a referendum on Britain's EU membership.
[754]
[755]
[756]
In 2018, during the Brexit negotiations, Johnson called for Britain to leave the
Single Market
[754]
and advocated a more liberal approach to immigration than that of Prime Minister Theresa May.
[757]
He stated many people believed that
Britain's EU membership
had led to the suppression of the wages of its "indigenous" people and said the EU was intent on creating a "superstate" that would seek to rob Britain of its sovereignty.
[754]
In 2019, Johnson said he would take Britain out of the EU on 31 October whether there was a trade deal in place or not.
[758]
Johnson also stated his opposition to a
referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement
.
[759]
On 19 August 2019, Johnson wrote a letter to the EU and asked for the removal of the "backstop" accord, which had previously been agreed and signed by Theresa May during her premiership. The president of the European Council,
Donald Tusk
, rejected the proposal.
[760]
On 26 August 2019, Johnson said that Britain would not pay £39 billion for the withdrawal agreement were the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October. The European Parliament Brexit coordinator
Guy Verhofstadt
said there would be no further negotiation on the trade deal unless the UK agreed to pay the entire sum.
[761]
[
needs update
]
Unionism and devolution
Speaking in
Northern Ireland
, Johnson described himself as a "fervent and passionate
unionist
".
[762]
He proposed building a
bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland
, but has since scrapped this initiative.
[763]
The devolved administrations have criticised the
Internal Market Bill
for its re-centralisation of control over commerce, reversing the
devolution of power in the United Kingdom
.
[764]

Johnson has been described by various biographers and commentators as having a light-hearted and charming persona,
[765]
[766]
[767]
[768]
[769]
many of whom suggest he has put significant thought and effort into developing this version of himself throughout his adult life.
[770]
[771]
[772]
[773]
He has been noted as making significant use of humour in relation to this, sometimes for explicitly political purposes.
[767]
[774]
[775]
Johnson has said that "humour is a utensil that you can use to sugar the pill and to get important points across".
[773]
He is said to have a genuine desire to be liked.
[776]
He has also been described, including by some of those that have known him personally, as heavily focused on his own interests,
[777]
[778]
[779]
with an often vitriolic or irresponsible way of conducting himself in private.
[780]
[781]
[782]
Johnson has been described as a divisive and controversial figure in British politics.
[783]
[784]
[785]
Supporters have praised him as humorous, witty, and entertaining.
[7]
Johnson has been accused of lying or making untruthful or misleading statements throughout his career,
[786]
and has been compared to former US president
Donald Trump
.
[787]
[788]
[789]
[790]
He has been considered a figure with broad appeal outside of the usual Conservative support base.
[791]
Johnson's premiership has been described by historians as the most controversial and scandal-affected since that of
David Lloyd George
about a century earlier.
[792]
Personal life
Since Johnson was born in New York City to British parents, he first held
British-American
dual citizenship
. In 2014, he acknowledged he was disputing a demand for
capital gains tax
from the
US tax authorities
on a property that he inherited in the United Kingdom,
[793]
[794]
which ultimately he paid.
[795]
In February 2015, he announced his intention to renounce his US citizenship to demonstrate his loyalty to the UK,
[796]
which he did in 2016.
[797]
Johnson has a knowledge of French, Italian, German, Spanish,
[93]
Latin
, and
Ancient Greek
,
[798]
frequently employing and alluding to
classical
references in both his newspaper columns and his speeches.
[770]
His favourite film is
The Godfather
, owing to "the multiple retribution killings at the end".
[799]
Sonia Purnell
wrote that Johnson was a "highly evasive figure" when it came to his personal life,
[800]
who remained detached from others and who had very few if any intimate friends.
[801]
Among friends and family, Johnson is more commonly known as Al (short for his forename Alexander), rather than his middle name Boris.
[802]
In 2007, Johnson said he had smoked
cannabis
before he went to university.
[803]
He has also said he had used
cocaine
.
[804]
Johnson partakes in cycling, tennis and
pilates
, and has returned to his passion for road
running
in 2023
[805]
which he temporarily gave up owing to knee problems.
[806]
Johnson's weight has fluctuated throughout his career; he was considered
obese
in 2018 and
overweight
in 2020, and has spoken of making efforts to lose weight.
[806]
[807]
Johnson previously owned a £1.3 million buy-to-let townhouse in
Camberwell
, South London. According to
HM Land Registry
documents, he bought the four-bedroom property with his then-girlfriend
Carrie Symonds
in July 2019. The register of MPs' interests states that Johnson had a rental income of at least £10,000 a year.
[808]
In August 2022, it was listed for sale for £1.6 million.
[809]
In 2023, Johnson and Symonds bought
Brightwell Manor
, a £3.8 million moated mansion in
Brightwell-cum-Sotwell
, Oxfordshire.
[810]
Religion
Johnson speaking at
Westminster Abbey
's
Commonwealth Day
Service, 2020
Johnson was baptised a
Catholic
and later
confirmed
into the
Church of England
,
[56]
but has said that his faith "comes and goes"
[811]
and that he is not a serious practising Christian.
[812]
In 2020, his son Wilfred was baptised Catholic, prompting suggestions that Johnson had returned to Catholicism.
[813]
Johnson and Symonds married in a Catholic ceremony at
Westminster Cathedral
on 29 May 2021.
[814]
To be married in the Catholic Church, Johnson needed to have his two previous marriages proven to be invalid by reason of
lack of canonical form
. Since he was baptised Catholic, but his previous weddings were not conferred by the Catholic Church, they are considered putatively invalid.
[815]
[816]
Johnson holds ancient Greek statesman and orator
Pericles
as a personal hero.
[817]
[818]
According to Johnson's biographer, Andrew Gimson, regarding ancient Greek and
Roman polytheism
: "it is clear that [Johnson] is inspired by the Romans, and even more by the Greeks, and repelled by the
early Christians
".
[819]
Johnson views
secular humanism
positively and sees it as owing more to the
classical world
than to Christian thinking.
[820]
However, in 2021, Johnson was asked if he held pre-Christian beliefs, which he denied, saying, "Christianity is a superb ethical system and I would count myself as a kind of very, very bad Christian[.] No disrespect to any other religions, but Christianity makes a lot of sense to me."

Carrie Symonds
at the 2020
Commonwealth Day
service
In 1987, Johnson married
Allegra Mostyn-Owen
, daughter of the art historian
William Mostyn-Owen
and Italian writer
Gaia Servadio
.
[825]
The couple's marriage ended in divorce or
annulment
in 1993
[f]
and 12 days later Johnson married
Marina Wheeler
, a barrister, daughter of journalist and broadcaster
Charles Wheeler
.
[829]
Five weeks later, Wheeler and Johnson's first child was born.
[830]
[831]
The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for decades,
[832]
and Marina Wheeler was at the European School, Brussels, at the same time as her future husband. They have four children:
Lara Lettice
, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches, and Theodore Apollo.
[833]
Between 2000 and 2004, Johnson had an affair with
Spectator
columnist
Petronella Wyatt
when he was its editor, resulting in a terminated pregnancy and a
miscarriage
.
[181]
In April 2006, the
News of the World
alleged that Johnson was having an affair with
Guardian
journalist Anna Fazackerley. The pair did not comment; shortly afterward, Johnson employed Fazackerley.
[192]
[193]
In 2009, Johnson fathered a daughter with Helen Macintyre, an arts consultant. In 2013, the
Court of Appeal
discharged an injunction banning reporting of his daughter's existence. The judge ruled the public had a right to know about Johnson's "reckless" behaviour.
[226]
[834]
[835]
There had been speculation that he might have had another child from an extramarital affair, due to an appeal court judge stating in 2013, "the father's infidelities resulted in the conception of children on two occasions".
[836]
In September 2021, after years of obfuscation, Johnson stated that he had (then) six children, thereby denying the existence of any further illegitimate children.
[837]
In September 2018, Johnson and Wheeler issued a statement confirming that after 25 years of marriage they had separated "several months ago", and had begun divorce proceedings.
[838]
They reached a financial settlement in February 2020,
[839]
and the divorce was finalised in 2020.
[840]
In October 2020,
Jennifer Arcuri
, when asked whether her friendship with Johnson was in fact an affair, said "I think that goes without saying ... But I'm not going to talk about it."
[841]
In March 2021, she went into more detail about the alleged affair in an interview with the
Sunday Mirror
, saying it lasted from 2012 to 2016.
[842]
[843]
In 2019, Johnson was living with
Carrie Symonds
, the daughter of
Matthew Symonds
, co-founder of
The Independent
newspaper. Symonds had worked for the Conservative party since 2009 and worked on Johnson's 2012 campaign to be re-elected as mayor.
[844]
On 29 February 2020, Johnson and Symonds announced they had become engaged in late 2019, and that Symonds was expecting a baby in early summer.
[845]
Their son, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson,
[846]
was born on 29 April 2020 at
University College Hospital
in London.
[847]
[848]
On 29 May 2021, Johnson married Symonds in a private ceremony at
Westminster Cathedral
attended by 30 guests,
[814]
[849]
becoming the first prime minister to marry in office since
Lord Liverpool
married
Mary Chester
in 1822.
[850]
On 31 July 2021, it was announced that they were expecting their second child together after Carrie suffered a miscarriage earlier that year.
[851]
Their daughter, Romy Iris Charlotte Johnson,
[852]
was born on 9 December 2021 at an NHS London hospital.
[853]
In May 2023, it was announced that they were expecting their third child together.
[854]
The child, a son named Frank Alfred Odysseus Johnson, was born on 5 July 2023.
[855]

2019 European Elections
.
[862]
Johnson also has two half-siblings,
Julia
and Maximilian, through his father's later marriage to Jennifer Kidd.
[863]
[864]
Johnson's paternal grandfather, Wilfred Johnson, was an RAF pilot in
Coastal Command
during the Second World War.
[865]
Wilfred Johnson's father was the
Ottoman
Interior Minister
and journalist
Ali Kemal
, who was a
secular Muslim
. Ali Kemal's father was a
Turk
with roots in
Kalfat
, a village in central Turkey, while his mother was a
Circassian
reputedly of
slave
origin.
[866]
[867]
[868]
His other paternal ancestry includes English, German and French; one of his German ancestors was said to be the
illegitimate
daughter of
Prince Paul of Württemberg

Who Do You Think You Are?
[870]
Johnson's mother is the granddaughter of
Elias Avery Lowe

, who was a
Russian Jewish
immigrant to the US,
[871]

Pennsylvania
-born
Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter
, a translator of
Thomas Mann
.

Anna Catharina Bischoff
, whose
mummified corpse
was found in 1975 and identified in 2018.
[873]
[874]
Referring to his varied ancestry, Johnson has described himself as a "one-man melting pot" with a combination of
Abrahamic religious
great-grandparents.
[875]
Johnson was also given the middle name "
Boris
" after a White Russian émigré named Boris Litwin, who was a friend of his parents.
[22]
An episode of
Who Do You Think You Are?
explored the German origins of his middle name
Pfeffel

The
Moshassuck Valley Railroad
(reporting mark
MOV
), founded in 1874, was a
shortline railroad
in
Rhode Island
, United States. Built from 1876 to 1877, it operated on a 2-mile (3.2 km) long line between
Lincoln
and a connection to the
Providence and Worcester
and
Boston and Providence
railroads, both of which were subsequently purchased by the
New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad
(the New Haven), in the Woodlawn neighborhood of
Pawtucket
. The company was formed by the Sayles brothers, owners of a significant mill in
Saylesville
near the line's terminus. Freight was the primary traffic of the railroad, but frequent passenger service was also provided by a self-propelled steam passenger car until 1921.
An expansion attempt southeastward from Woodlawn to the
Seekonk River
was launched in the first decade of the 20th century, but was abandoned in 1913 following opposition from the New Haven. Independent freight operations continued until 1982, when the company was purchased by the
Providence and Worcester Railroad
(which separated from New Haven successor
Penn Central
in 1973 and resumed operating its own lines) which has operated the line since. The northernmost three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) of the line were abandoned in 1991, with the remainder of the line in active use as of 2022.
History
[
edit
]
Founding and construction
[
edit
]
The Moshassuck Valley Railroad was chartered on June 11, 1874, by brothers William and Frederic Sayles, owners of a large mill in eponymous
Saylesville
, to connect their mill and the village to the national railroad network in Woodlawn, a neighborhood of
Pawtucket
.
[1]
[2]
There, the Moshassuck Valley connected to the joint lines of the
Providence and Worcester Railroad
and the
Boston and Providence Railroad
, just north of
Providence
.
[3]
The company ran a locomotive for the first time on December 6, 1876; it opened for business the following month.
[3]
[4]
The completed
shortline railroad
was two miles (3.2 km) in length and followed the
Moshassuck River
for much of the route.
[2]
Operations
[
edit
]
The Moshassuck Valley Railroad's steam passenger car in 1916
The Moshassuck Valley Railroad began with one locomotive, the
Moshassuck
. This locomotive was later supplemented by a second, the
Lorraine
. In 1889, the company ordered a new, more powerful locomotive from the
Rhode Island Locomotive Works
to replace the
Moshassuck
, which was no longer sufficient to handle growing freight traffic.
[5]
Though freight service was always the primary purpose of the Moshassuck Valley Railroad, the company also provided passenger service between Saylesville and the
New Haven Railroad
's Woodlawn depot (the New Haven was the lessor of both the Providence & Worcester and the Boston & Providence). A self-propelled
steam dummy
with passenger accommodations made up to 13 round trips per day on the line, which included three full stations and a further five
flag stops
. The
Boston Globe
wrote in 1903 that "There is no combination car and locomotive like the one on the Moshassuck in use in any part of this country, it is believed by the operators of this one."
[2]
Passenger service continued until 1921, when it was ended following increased competition from
streetcars
.
[3]
In 1960, the Saylesville mill shut down. Despite this, other local industries continued to rely on the railroad, and it continued operating.
[3]
By 1969, the Moshassuck Valley Railroad employed five people.
[6]
Expansion attempt
[
edit
]
In the early 1900s, the Moshassuck Valley Railroad launched an attempt to extend its line from Woodlawn to the
Seekonk River
, enabling the company to exchange cargo with ships and directly compete with the New Haven. An amendment to the company's charter allowing the extension was approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly on April 7, 1904.
[7]
The charter amendment required the Moshassuck to determine and acquire a right-of-way for the extension within two years, and additionally required the extension to be an electrified railroad. In April 1906, the company formally filed notice that it had obtained a right-of-way and would begin construction.
[8]
Construction of the extension did not proceed smoothly, as the New Haven Railroad objected to the route passing through land it owned at Woodlawn, asserting the land was needed for future use as part of an expansion of
Northup Avenue Yard
.
[9]
The New Haven stated it had no objections to the expansion in principle, and would be satisfied if the extension crossed over the area of the yard on a bridge, which would need to be 200 to 300 feet in length.
[10]
The Moshassuck Valley Railroad abandoned its plans to build the extension in December 1913, with newspapers speculating that this was either because the company believed the
Southern New England Railway
(then under construction) would allow another connection to the river, or because the company was confident in its ability to maintain good relations with the New Haven Railroad.
[11]
Purchase by Providence and Worcester
[
edit
]
The terminus of the Moshassuck Industrial Track in 2022
In 1982, the
Providence and Worcester Railroad
(P&W) purchased the Moshassuck Valley Railroad, ending its independence after 105 years of continuous operations.
[3]
Long leased by the New Haven, the P&W broke free from New Haven successor
Penn Central
in 1973 and resumed train operations.
[12]
The line became the P&W's Moshassuck Industrial Track, serving several local industries. P&W cut back the northernmost three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) of the line in 1991, while the remaining portion continues to serve a local industry as of 2022.
[3]
The line is maintained to Class 1 standards, meaning a maximum speed limit of 10 miles per hour (16 km/h).
[13]
The wye at Woodlawn is also used by
Amtrak
and P&W to turn railroad equipment.

421 BC treaty between Athens and Sparta
Peace of Nicias
The treaty is named for Athenian Statesmen and General Nicias.
Type
Peace treaty
Signed
March 421 BC
Signatories
Nicias
King Pleistoanax
Parties
Athens
Sparta
Language
Ancient Greek
The
Peace of Nicias
was a
peace treaty
signed between the
Greek
city-states
of
Athens
and
Sparta
in March 421 BC that ended the first half of the
Peloponnesian War
.
[1]
In 425 BC, the Spartans had lost the battles of
Pylos
and
Sphacteria
, a severe defeat resulting in the Athenians holding 292 prisoners. At least 120 were
Spartiates
, who had recovered by 424 BC, when the Spartan general
Brasidas
captured
Amphipolis
. In the same year, the Athenians suffered a major defeat in
Boeotia
at the
Battle of Delium
, and in 422 BC, they were defeated again at the
Battle of Amphipolis
in their attempt to take back that city. Both Brasidas, the leading Spartan general, and
Cleon
, the leading politician in Athens, were killed at Amphipolis. By then, both sides were exhausted and ready for peace.
The negotiations were started by
Pleistoanax
,
King of Sparta
, and
Nicias
, an Athenian general. The most amicable proposal was to return everything to the prewar state except for
Nisaea
and
Plataea
. Athens would retain control of
Nisaea
and
Thebes
would retain control over Plataea. Amphipolis would be returned to Athens and Pylos would be returned to Sparta. Athenians would release the Spartan prisoners taken at Sphacteria and Sparta together with Thebes would return Athenian prisoners. Temples throughout Greece would be open to worshipers from all cities, and the
oracle
at
Delphi
would regain its autonomy. Athens would continue to collect tribute from the states from which it had received it since the time of
Aristides
, but Athens could not force them to become allies. Athens also agreed to come to Sparta's aid if the
helots
revolted. Few of Sparta's allies agreed to sign the peace.
Boeotia
,
Corinth
,
Elis
,
Megara
and
Amphipolis
opposed the treaty.
Seventeen representatives from each side swore an oath to uphold the treaty, which was meant to last for fifty years. The Spartan representatives were the kings Pleistoanax and
Agis II
, Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antiphus, Tellis, Alcindas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus. The Athenian representatives were Lampon, Isthmonicus, Nicias,
Laches
, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon,
Lamachus
, and
Demosthenes
. However, Athens's chief goal, the restoration of Amphipolis, was denied when Clearidas obtained from the Spartans a clause in the treaty negating the transfer. The treaty was broken from the start and, after several more failures, was formally abandoned in 414 BC. The Peloponnesian War resumed the second stage.

[1]
) is a youth fiddle group from
Nanaimo, British Columbia
, founded in 2011.
[2]
There are two tiers in the group; senior and junior. The senior group consists of 14 members between the ages of 12 and 18,
[3]
and an accompanist who acts as co-director alongside the director. The junior group is made up of 4 members who play with the senior group on certain songs. The group as a whole is primarily composed of
violin
players, with three or occasionally four
viola
players (one member plays both violin and viola) and a
cello
player. The accompanist plays piano and guitar and the director occasionally plays the double bass. The group was founded by director Trish Horrocks and accompanist Geoff Horrocks, wife and husband. The group has released two albums,
Fiddelium
[4]
and
Lit Up
. The former won a
Canadian Folk Music Award
in 2023 in the Young Performers of the Year category,
[5]
[6]
and the latter was nominated for the same in the 2024 awards.
[7]
The group has also won two CBC Music Class Challenges in 2020
[8]
[9]
and 2021,
[10]
[11]
respectively.
The membership of Fiddelium has changed over the years, with members often leaving the group after graduating from high-school, and various younger members replacing them. Some years there is a junior program and other years there have been just senior players. Junior players usually graduate to the senior level after one year.

Animals
are
multicellular
,
eukaryotic
organisms
in the
biological kingdom
Animalia
. With few exceptions, animals
consume organic material
,
breathe oxygen
, have
myocytes
and are
able to move
, can
reproduce sexually
, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the
blastula
, during
embryonic development
. As of 2022, 2.16 million
living
animal
species
have been
described
—of which around 1.05 million are
insects
, over 85,000 are
molluscs
, and around 65,000 are
vertebrates
. It has been estimated there are around 7.77 million animal species. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have
complex interactions
with each other and their environments, forming intricate
food webs
. The scientific study of animals is known as
zoology
.
Most living animal species are in
Bilateria
, a
clade
whose members have a
bilaterally symmetric
body plan
. The Bilateria include the
protostomes
, containing animals such as
nematodes
,
arthropods
,
flatworms
,
annelids
and molluscs, and the
deuterostomes
, containing the
echinoderms
and the
chordates
, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the
Ediacaran biota
of the late
Precambrian
. Many modern animal
phyla
became clearly established in the
fossil record
as
marine species
during the
Cambrian explosion
, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of
genes
common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single
common ancestor
that lived
650 million years ago
.
Historically,
Aristotle divided animals
into those with blood and those without.
Carl Linnaeus
created the first hierarchical
biological classification
for animals in 1758 with his
Systema Naturae
, which
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874,
Ernst Haeckel
divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular
Metazoa
(now
synonymous
with Animalia) and the
Protozoa
, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as
molecular phylogenetics
, which are effective at demonstrating the
evolutionary
relationships between
taxa
.
Humans
make
use of many animal species
, such as for food (including
meat
), for materials (such as
leather
and
wool
), as
pets
, and as
working animals
including for transport.
Dogs
have been
used in hunting
, as have
birds of prey
, while many terrestrial and
aquatic animals
were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art since the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.
Etymology
The word "animal" comes from the Latin
animalis
, meaning 'having breath', 'having soul' or 'living being'.
[4]
The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia.
[5]
In colloquial usage, the term
animal
is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.
[6]
[7]
[8]
[9]
The term "metazoa" is derived from the Ancient Greek μετα (
meta
, meaning "later") and ζῷᾰ (
zōia
, plural of ζῷον
zōion,
meaning animal).
[10]
[11]
Characteristics
Animals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early
embryo
(1) develop into a hollow ball or
blastula
(2).
Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are
eukaryotic
and
multicellular
.
[12]
Unlike plants and
algae
, which
produce their own nutrients
,
[13]
animals are
heterotrophic
,
[14]
[15]
feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.
[16]
With very few exceptions, animals
respire aerobically
.
[a]
[18]
All animals are
motile
[19]
(able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their
life cycle
, but some animals, such as
sponges
,
corals
,
mussels
, and
barnacles
, later become
sessile
. The
blastula
is a stage in
embryonic development
that is unique to animals, allowing
cells to be differentiated
into specialised tissues and organs.
[20]
Structure
All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic
extracellular matrix
composed of
collagen
and elastic
glycoproteins
.
[21]
During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as
shells
,
bones
, and
spicules
.
[22]
In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth.
[23]
Animal cells uniquely possess the
cell junctions
called
tight junctions
,
gap junctions
, and
desmosomes
.
[24]
With few exceptions—in particular, the sponges and
placozoans
—animal bodies are differentiated into
tissues
.
[25]
These include
muscles
, which enable locomotion, and
nerve tissues
, which transmit signals and coordinate the body. Typically, there is also an internal
digestive
chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians).
[26]
Reproduction and development
See also:
Sexual reproduction § Animals
, and
Asexual reproduction § Examples in animals
Sexual reproduction
is nearly universal in animals, such as these
dragonflies
.
Nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction.
[27]
They produce
haploid
gametes
by
meiosis
; the smaller, motile gametes are
spermatozoa
and the larger, non-motile gametes are
ova
.
[28]
These fuse to form
zygotes
,
[29]
which develop via
mitosis
into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge.
[30]
In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement.
[31]
It first
invaginates
to form a
gastrula
with a digestive chamber and two separate
germ layers
, an external
ectoderm
and an internal
endoderm
.
[32]
In most cases, a third germ layer, the
mesoderm
, also develops between them.
[33]
These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.
[34]
Repeated instances of
mating with a close relative
during sexual reproduction generally leads to
inbreeding depression
within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful
recessive
traits.
[35]
[36]
Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for
avoiding close inbreeding
.
[37]
Some animals are capable of
asexual reproduction
, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through
fragmentation
;
budding
, such as in
Hydra
and other
cnidarians
; or
parthenogenesis
, where fertile eggs are produced without
mating
, such as in
aphids
.
[38]
[39]
Ecology
Predators
, such as this
ultramarine flycatcher
(
Ficedula superciliaris
), feed on other animals.
Animals are categorised into
ecological
groups depending on how they obtain or consume organic material, including
carnivores
,
herbivores
,
omnivores
,
detritivores
,
[40]
and
parasites
.
[41]
Interactions between animals form complex
food webs
. In carnivorous or omnivorous species,
predation
is a
consumer-resource interaction
where a predator feeds on another organism (called its
prey
).
[42]
Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an
evolutionary arms race
between predator and prey, resulting in various
anti-predator adaptations
.
[43]
[44]
Almost all multicellular predators are animals.
[45]
Some
consumers
use multiple methods; for example, in
parasitoid wasps
, the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process,
[46]
but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers.
[47]
Other animals may have very specific
feeding behaviours
, such as
hawksbill sea turtles
primarily
eating sponges
.
[48]
Hydrothermal vent
mussels and shrimps
Most animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through
photosynthesis
. Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on higher
trophic levels
typically acquire it indirectly by eating other animals. Animals oxidize
carbohydrates
,
lipids
,
proteins
, and other biomolecules, which allows the animal to grow and to sustain biological processes such as
locomotion
.
[49]
[50]
[51]
Animals living close to
hydrothermal vents
and
cold seeps
on the dark
sea floor
consume organic matter of
archaea
and bacteria produced in these locations through
chemosynthesis
(by oxidizing inorganic compounds, such as
hydrogen sulfide
).
[52]
Animals originally evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as
land plants
, probably between 510 and 471 million years ago during the
Late Cambrian
or Early
Ordovician
.
[53]
Vertebrates
such as the
lobe-finned fish
Tiktaalik
started to move on to land in the late
Devonian
, about 375 million years ago.
[54]
[55]
Animals occupy virtually all of earth's
habitats
and microhabitats, including salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of other animals, plants, fungi, and rocks.
[56]
Animals are however not particularly
heat tolerant
; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 °C (122 °F).
[57]
Only very few species of animals (mostly
nematodes
) inhabit the most extreme cold deserts of continental
Antarctica
.

The largest extant terrestrial animal is the
African bush elephant
(
Loxodonta africana
), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes
[59]
and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long.
[59]
The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were
titanosaur
sauropod dinosaurs
such as
Argentinosaurus
, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes, and
Supersaurus
which may have reached 39 meters.
[62]
[63]
Several animals are microscopic; some
Myxozoa
(
obligate parasites
within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20
µm
,
[64]
and one of the smallest species (
Myxobolus shekel
) is no more than 8.5 µm when fully grown.
[65]
Numbers and habitats of major phyla
The following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the major animal phyla,
[66]
along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water,
[67]
and marine),
[68]
and free-living or parasitic ways of life.
[69]
Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000-27,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000-20,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million.
[70]
Using patterns within the
taxonomic
hierarchy, the total number of animal species—including those not yet described—was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.

Evolutionary origin
Further information:
Urmetazoan
Animals are found as long ago as the
Ediacaran biota
, towards the end of the
Precambrian
, and possibly somewhat earlier. It had long been doubted whether these life-forms included animals,
[87]
[88]
[89]
but the discovery of the animal lipid
cholesterol
in fossils of
Dickinsonia
establishes their nature.
[90]
Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by
anaerobic respiration
, but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments.
[91]
Many animal phyla first appear in the
fossil
record during the
Cambrian explosion
, starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the
Burgess shale
.
[92]
Extant phyla in these rocks include
molluscs
,
brachiopods
,
onychophorans
,
tardigrades
,
arthropods
,
echinoderms
and
hemichordates
, along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the
predatory
Anomalocaris
. The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously.
[93]
[94]
[95]
[96]
That view is supported by the discovery of
Auroralumina attenboroughii
, the earliest known Ediacaran crown-group cnidarian (557-562 mya, some 20 million years before the Cambrian explosion) from
Charnwood Forest
, England. It is thought to be one of the earliest
predators
, catching small prey with its
nematocysts
as modern cnidarians do.
[97]
Some palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago.
[98]
Early fossils that might represent animals appear for example in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the
Trezona Formation
of
South Australia
. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early
sponges
.
[99]
Trace fossils
such as tracks and burrows found in the
Tonian
period (from 1 gya) may indicate the presence of
triploblastic
worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms.
[100]
However, similar tracks are produced by the giant single-celled protist
Gromia sphaerica
, so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution.
[101]
[102]
Around the same time, the layered mats of
microorganisms
called
stromatolites
decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals.
[103]
Objects such as sediment-filled tubes that resemble trace fossils of the burrows of wormlike animals have been found in 1.2 gya rocks in North America, in 1.5 gya rocks in Australia and North America, and in 1.7 gya rocks in Australia. Their interpretation as having an animal origin is disputed, as they might be water-escape or other structures.
[104]
[105]
Dickinsonia costata
from the
Ediacaran biota
(c. 635-542 mya) is one of the earliest animal species known.
[90]
Auroralumina attenboroughii
, an Ediacaran predator (c. 560 mya)
[97]
Anomalocaris canadensis
is one of the many animal species that emerged in the
Cambrian explosion
, starting some 539 mya, and found in the fossil beds of the
Burgess shale
.
Phylogeny

Lists of animals
External phylogeny
Animals are
monophyletic
, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are sister to the
Choanoflagellata
, with which they form the
Choanozoa
.
[106]
The dates on the
phylogenetic tree
indicate approximately how many millions of years ago (
mya
) the lineages split.
[107]
[108]

Internal phylogeny
The most
basal animals
, the
Porifera
,
Ctenophora
,
Cnidaria
, and
Placozoa
, have body plans that lack
bilateral symmetry
. Their relationships are still disputed; the sister group to all other animals could be the Porifera or the Ctenophora,
[113]
both of which lack
hox genes
,
important in body plan development
.
[114]
These genes are found in the Placozoa
[115]
[116]
and the higher animals, the Bilateria.
[117]
[118]
6,331 groups of
genes
common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single
common ancestor
that lived
650 million years ago
in the
Precambrian
. 25 of these are novel core gene groups, found only in animals; of those, 8 are for essential components of the
Wnt
and
TGF-beta
signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become multicellular by providing a pattern for the body's system of axes (in three dimensions), and another 7 are for
transcription factors
including
homeodomain
proteins involved in the
control of development
.
[119]
[120]
Giribet and Edgecombe (2020) provide what they consider to be a consensus internal phylogeny of the animals, embodying uncertainty about the structure at the base of the tree (dashed lines).

An alternative phylogeny, from Kapli and colleagues (2021), proposes a clade

for the Xenacoelamorpha + Ambulacraria; this is either within Deuterostomia, as sister to Chordata, or the Deuterostomia are recovered as paraphyletic, and Xenambulacraria is sister to the proposed clade
Centroneuralia
, consisting of Chordata + Protostomia.
[122]
Non-bilateria
Non-bilaterians include sponges (centre) and corals (background).
Several animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry. These are the
Porifera
(sea sponges),
Placozoa
,
Cnidaria
(which includes
jellyfish
,
sea anemones
, and corals), and
Ctenophora
(comb jellies).
Sponges are physically very distinct from other animals, and were long thought to have diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum and forming a
sister clade
to all other animals.
[123]
Despite their morphological dissimilarity with all other animals, genetic evidence suggests sponges may be more closely related to other animals than the comb jellies are.
[124]
[125]
Sponges lack the complex organization found in most other animal phyla;
[126]
their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues, unlike all other animals.
[127]
They typically feed by drawing in water through pores, filtering out food and nutrients.
[128]
The comb jellies and Cnidaria are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus.
[129]
Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into discrete
organs
.
[130]
They are
diploblastic
, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm.
[131]
The tiny placozoans have no permanent digestive chamber and no symmetry; they superficially resemble amoebae.
[132]
[133]
Their phylogeny is poorly defined, and under active research.
[124]
[134]
Bilateria
Main articles:
Bilateria
and
Symmetry (biology) § Bilateral symmetry
Idealised
bilaterian
body plan.
[d]
With an elongated body and a direction of movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the
basis of the head
. Opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable
peristaltic motion
.
The remaining animals, the great majority—comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species—form a
clade
, the Bilateria, which have a bilaterally symmetric
body plan
. The Bilateria are
triploblastic
, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues
form distinct organs
. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a
coelom
or pseudocoelom. These animals have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior), a back (dorsal) surface and a belly (ventral) surface, and a left and a right side.
[135]
[136]
Having a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring
cephalisation
, the development of a head with
sense organs
and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular
muscles
that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body;
[136]
these enable soft-bodied animals with a
hydrostatic skeleton
to move by
peristalsis
.
[137]
They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary
larvae
which swim with
cilia
and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, over evolutionary time, descendant spaces have evolved which have lost one or more of each of these characteristics. For example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some
parasitic worms
have extremely simplified body structures.
[135]
[136]
Genetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the
protostomes
and the
deuterostomes
.
[138]
It is often suggested that the basalmost bilaterians are the
Xenacoelomorpha
, with all other bilaterians belonging to the subclade
Nephrozoa
[139]
[140]
[141]
However, this suggestion has been contested, with other studies finding that xenacoelomorphs are more closely related to Ambulacraria than to other bilaterians.
[122]
Protostomes and deuterostomes
Further information:
Embryological origins of the mouth and anus
Main articles:
Protostome
and
Deuterostome
The bilaterian gut develops in two ways. In many
protostomes
, the blastopore develops into the mouth, while in
deuterostomes
it becomes the anus.
Protostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial
cleavage
during cell division, while many protostomes (the
Spiralia
) undergo spiral cleavage.
[142]
Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the
embryonic gut
develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily.
[143]
[144]
Most protostomes have
schizocoelous development
, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by
enterocoelic pouching
, through invagination of the endoderm.
[145]
The main deuterostome phyla are the Echinodermata and the Chordata.
[146]
Echinoderms are exclusively marine and include
starfish
,
sea urchins
, and
sea cucumbers
.
[147]
The chordates are dominated by the
vertebrates
(animals with
backbones
),
[148]
which consist of
fishes
,
amphibians
,
reptiles
,
birds
, and
mammals
.
[149]
The deuterostomes also include the
Hemichordata
(acorn worms).
[150]
[151]
Ecdysozoa
Main article:
Ecdysozoa
Ecdysis
: a
dragonfly
has emerged from its dry
exuviae
and is expanding its wings. Like other
arthropods
, its body is
divided into segments
.
The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared
trait
of
ecdysis
, growth by moulting.
[152]
They include the largest animal phylum, the
Arthropoda
, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All of these have a body divided into
repeating segments
, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the
Onychophora
and
Tardigrada
, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water;
[153]
some are important parasites.
[154]
Smaller phyla related to them are the
Nematomorpha
or horsehair worms, and the
Kinorhyncha
,
Priapulida
, and
Loricifera
. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.
[155]
Spiralia
Main article:
Spiralia
Spiral cleavage
in a sea snail embryo
The Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo.
[156]
The Spiralia's phylogeny has been disputed, but it contains a large clade, the superphylum
Lophotrochozoa
, and smaller groups of phyla such as the
Rouphozoa
which includes the
gastrotrichs
and the
flatworms
. All of these are grouped as the
Platytrochozoa
, which has a sister group, the
Gnathifera
, which includes the
rotifers
.
[157]
[158]
The Lophotrochozoa includes the
molluscs
,
annelids
,
brachiopods
,
nemerteans
,
bryozoa
and
entoprocts
.
[157]
[159]
[160]
The molluscs, the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes
snails
,
clams
, and
squids
, while the annelids are the segmented worms, such as
earthworms
,
lugworms
, and
leeches
. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because they share
trochophore
larvae.
[161]
[162]
History of classification
Further information:
Taxonomy (biology)
,
History of zoology through 1859
, and
History of zoology since 1859
Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck
led the creation of a modern classification of invertebrates, breaking up Linnaeus's "Vermes" into 9 phyla by 1809.
[163]
In the
classical era
, Aristotle
divided animals
,
[e]
based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then
arranged on a scale
from man (with blood, 2 legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4 legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul).
Aristotle
was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch, and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about.
[164]
In 1758,
Carl Linnaeus
created the first
hierarchical
classification in his
Systema Naturae
.
[165]
In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of
Vermes
,
Insecta
,
Pisces
,
Amphibia
,
Aves
, and
Mammalia
. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the
Chordata
, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by
Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck
, who called the Vermes
une espèce de chaos
(a chaotic mess)
[f]
and split the group into three new phyla: worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his
Philosophie Zoologique
, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely
cirripedes
, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms,
radiates
, polyps, and
infusorians
.
[163]
In his 1817
Le Règne Animal
,
Georges Cuvier
used
comparative anatomy
to group the animals into four
embranchements
("branches" with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and
zoophytes (radiata)
(echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms).
[167]
This division into four was followed by the embryologist
Karl Ernst von Baer
in 1828, the zoologist
Louis Agassiz
in 1857, and the comparative anatomist
Richard Owen
in 1860.
[168]
In 1874,
Ernst Haeckel
divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges.
[169]
[168]
The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom
Protista
, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia.

[172]
Marine fish of many species are
caught commercially
for food. A smaller number of species are

[172]
[177]
[178]
Animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles, while animal
sinews
have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats.

History
[
edit
]
Railroad station
[
edit
]
The new bridge over Centre Street in 1896
The
Boston and Providence Railroad
opened through Roxbury in June 1834. Local stations were gradually added; trains began serving
Heath Street
around the 1850s.
[3]
: 154
[4]
In 1867, the
Massachusetts legislature
ordered the railroad to build a new station building at New Heath Street, slightly to the north.
[5]
The new station was completed in 1872.
[6]
[7]
It was a one-story wood building located on the west side of the tracks north of Heath Street (rather than at New Heath Street).
[8]
[9]
Starting in 1891, the
Old Colony Railroad
(acquired in 1893 by the
New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad
) raised the section of its main line through Jamaica Plain (extending from
Massachusetts Avenue
to
Forest Hills
) onto a 4-track stone embankment to eliminate dangerous grade crossings.  The project involved the replacement of the five NYNH&H stations in
Roxbury
and Jamaica Plain; the new elevated stations opened on June 1, 1897.
[10]
[11]
On November 22, 1909, the
Washington Street Elevated
was extended south from
Dudley Square
(now Nubian Square) to Forest Hills.
[1]
Although the five NYNH&H stations in Roxbury and Jamaica Plain continued to operate, they were ultimately unable to compete with the Elevated.
[11]
Heath Street station closed in the early 1930s.
Orange Line station
[
edit
]
A train at Jackson Square in 2016
In the 1960s, plans took hold to extend
I-95
into downtown Boston along the NYNH&H's right-of-way and to replace the Washington Street Elevated (after 1967 known as the
Orange Line
) with a rapid transit line running in the new highway's median. Although the project was halted by
highway revolts
in 1969 and the February 11, 1970 announcement by Governor
Francis W. Sargent
of a moratorium on new highway construction within the
Route 128
corridor, and eventually cancelled by Governor Sargent in 1972, the right-of-way had already been cleared.  This empty strip of land (known as the
Southwest Corridor
) was eventually developed into the
Southwest Corridor Park
, and the Orange Line was moved to a new alignment along the Corridor in 1987 despite the cancellation of the project originally calling for its relocation.  This included a new rapid transit station, Jackson Square, at Centre Streetsouth of the former NYNH&H station. The Washington Street Elevated was permanently closed on April 30, 1987, and the new southern half of the Orange Line, including Stony Brook, opened on May 4.
[10]
[1]
In 2004, the MBTA added murals as well as better lighting and new sidewalks after a spree of violent crimes near the station. The improvements at the station were designed to reduce criminal activity as well as provide a more welcoming atmosphere for transit riders.
[12]
[13]
Additional murals were added in December 2007.
[14]
The entire Orange Line, including Jackson Square station, was closed from August 19 to September 18, 2022, during maintenance work.
[15]
The MBTA plans to add a second platform elevator, rebuild the existing elevator, and make other repairs to the station. A $4.7 million design contract for Jackson Square and
Massachusetts Avenue
was awarded in April 2020.
[16]
[17]
Design work reached 30% completion in 2021 and 75% completion in 2022.
[18]
[16]
[19]
The MBTA also plans to convert the currently-southbound-only busway to bidrectional bus traffic in 2024 as part of construction of bus lanes on Columbus Avenue.

Trojan
" is the first episode of
science fiction
sitcom
Red Dwarf
series X
.
[1]
Originally broadcast on the British television channel
Dave
on 4 October 2012, it marked the return of
Red Dwarf
to a regular series run, 13 years after the conclusion of series 8. The episode touches upon
Rimmer
's relationship with his brothers and his urge to become an officer, following the discovery of a hologram of his brother Howard.
Plot
[
edit
]
Lister
(
Craig Charles
) and
the Cat
(
Danny John-Jules
) are tricked into attempting to buy a useless drinks stirring device from an automated
telemarketing
system, "All-Droid". Meanwhile, Rimmer (
Chris Barrie
) has once again failed to pass his astro-navigation test, and has not become an officer like his three brothers. At that moment, the crew discover a derelict "Quantum Twister" ship,
SS Trojan
, which is driven by a "quantum rod". While messing with the rod, Rimmer inadvertently summons a ship which carries a
hologram
of his brother
Howard
(
Mark Dexter
). Despite Howard's ship being in dire trouble, Rimmer opts to try to pass another exam to become an officer, and match his brother, before rescuing him.
Rimmer's attempts to revise for a further exam go badly, and after the other three crew members best him in a question about
moose
-related car accidents in the 1970s
Sweden
, Rimmer's light bee
crashes
due to a buildup of "resentment".
Kryten
(
Robert Llewellyn
) manages to restart it by "purging" his resentment, but since he is out of time to sit an exam, he decides to lie to his brother instead.
Rimmer and the other members of the crew dress up in Space Corps uniforms and welcome Howard aboard
Trojan
, with Rimmer posing as the ship's captain. Howard is accompanied by a simulant, Crawford (Susan Earl), and is dumbfounded that his brother appears to be a successful officer. After a tour of the ship, Howard becomes increasingly jealous of Rimmer and crashes due to a buildup of resentment, as Rimmer had earlier. After Howard's resentment is purged, Crawford reveals herself to be a simulant rebel, and intends to shoot everyone on board to free herself from human servitude. At this moment Lister finally manages to get through to a sales representative for All-Droid after days of being put on hold. Frustrated, Lister reaches for the phone, prompting Crawford to shoot; the shot misses Lister and instead heads for Rimmer. Howard places himself between Rimmer and Crawford, mortally wounding himself. Crawford is defeated by Kryten and the Cat, who upload Howard's resentment into her, causing her to crash. Howard, dying of his injuries, reconciles with Rimmer and admits that he wasn't an officer as was thought; like Rimmer, he was merely a
vending machine
repairman. Rimmer does not reciprocate the gesture, and merely reduces the size of his lie slightly (claiming that he had one fewer car than he had bragged, but was still wildly successful).
Later on, on board Red Dwarf, Lister has re-purposed Crawford's body as a drink stirring machine, and Rimmer is smugly satisfied that his brother died a low-ranking repairman after years of picking on his younger brother. But the computer system is updated with news of Howard's death, and due to his bravery, Howard is posthumously awarded the Platinum Star of Fortitude, with the recommendation that Red Dwarf be renamed
S.S. Howard Rimmer
. Rimmer suffers another resentment-fueled crash.
Production
[
edit
]
This original title for this episode was "Slow Rescue" but it was changed when it was realised that it was not a dynamic title for a new series.
[2]
The episode was dedicated to the memory of Jo Howard (Production Manager for Series VII; Line Producer for Series VIII; and Producer for Back to Earth).
[3]
Cultural references
[
edit
]
The high level of
moose
collisions in
Sweden
is well-documented. An increase in both moose and car numbers in the 1970s brought a substantial increase in moose-related accidents, peaking in 1980 when about 6000 moose vehicle collisions occurred.
[4]
Howard's claim that Rimmer's brain is "smaller than the salad section in a Scottish supermarket" refers to the notorious
Scottish diet
which is widely seen as one of the worst in the world.
[5]
In the final moments of the episode, after reading that Red Dwarf is to be renamed, Lister says he'll 'go and get me paintbrush'. This is a reference to the opening credits of Series 1 and 2, where Lister is seen using a paintbrush to paint the 'Red Dwarf' name on the side of the ship.
Ratings
[
edit
]
The episode was watched by 1.976 million viewers.
[6]
When added to the repeat airings over the following two days, then the number of viewers rose to nearly 3.3 million people.
[7]
Critical reception
[
edit
]
The episode received generally positive reviews, Michael Hogan writing for
The Telegraph
said it was "no classic but largely a return to form", giving the episode 3.5 stars out of 5.
[8]
SFX
magazine gave it 4 stars out of 5 saying "Trojan was clever enough to be bloody good, but with room for improvement. And you know what? There's every reason to believe that this series can get better."
[9]
"What Culture" gave it 5 stars out of 5 saying "If this episode is any indication of what we can look forward to for the rest of the series, I am a very happy person indeed. Red Dwarf is back, and I couldn't be happier!"
[10]
Starburst
magazine gave it 8 stars out of 10, and said that "writer/director Doug Naylor has rekindled the winning formula and produced an extremely promising opening episode."
[11]
Radio Times
called it "a lively re-creation of the show as we most fondly remember it,"
[12]
whilst the
Shropshire Star
said "it is indeed good to see the boys back in town, occupying a galaxy with infinite possibilities and spreading joy on whichever planet they land."

The
Phaedra complex
(
/
ˈ
f
iː
d
r
ə
,
ˈ
f
ɛ
d
r
ə
/
[1]
) is an informal, non-scientific designation to the
sexual desire
of a
stepmother
for her stepson,
[2]
though the term has been extended to cover difficult relationships between stepparents and stepchildren in general.
[3]
Origins
[
edit
]
Hippolytus after the confession of Phedra, his mother-in-law, by
Étienne-Barthélémy Garnier
;
Musée Ingres
, Montauban
The complex takes its name from
Greek mythology
.
Phaedra
was the daughter of
Minos
and
Pasiphaë
, wife of
Theseus
, sister of
Ariadne
, and the mother of
Demophon of Athens
and
Acamas
. Though married to Theseus, Phaedra fell in love with
Hippolytus
, Theseus' son born by either
Hippolyta
, queen of the
Amazons
, or
Antiope
, her sister.
[4]
When Hippolytus refused Phaedra's advances, she falsely accused him of propositioning her. Phaedra eventually killed herself in remorse after his subsequent death.
[5]
Cultural analogues
[
edit
]
Amata
in the
Aeneid
has been seen as cognate to Phaedra in her love for her future son-in-law
Turnus
and her eventual suicide at the news of his death.
[6]
In the
Hebrew Bible
,
Zuleikha
made a pass at her adoptive son
Joseph
, but Joseph refused her. So, Zuleikha accused Joseph of rape and he was put in prison, but eventually released. According to the tradition, Zuleikha made advances at many other foster children before Joseph.
In the ballad
Child Owlet
, Lady Erskine propositions her nephew, and upon rebuttal accuses him of attempting to seduce her, leading to his murder.
Other use
[
edit
]
French philosopher
Georges Bataille
used the same term in a very different sense to describe the
morbid desire
for a corpse.

Chief Illiniwek
was the mascot
[1]
of the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
(UIUC), associated with the university's intercollegiate athletic programs, from October 30, 1926, to February 21, 2007. Chief Illiniwek was portrayed by a student to represent the
Illiniwek
, the state's namesake, although the regalia worn was from the
Sioux
. The student portraying Chief Illiniwek performed during
halftime
of
Illinois football
and
basketball
games, as well as during
women's volleyball
matches.
For more than two decades, Chief Illiniwek had been the center of
a controversy
between fans and alumni who view the mascot as part of the UIUC tradition; while Native American individuals and organizations, social scientists, and educators view such mascots as
cultural appropriation
of indigenous images and rituals, which perpetuate
stereotypes about American Indian peoples
. In 2005, Chief Illiniwek was one of 19 mascots cited as "hostile or abusive" by the
NCAA
in
a policy
that banned schools from full participation in postseason activities as long as they continued to use such mascots.
[2]
[3]
The University of Illinois retired Chief Illiniwek in 2007, with his last official performance on February 21, 2007.
[4]
UIUC has not selected a replacement. A non-binding resolution to make "Alma Otter" the official mascot was placed on the spring 2019 student election ballot, but failed to receive a majority, although some see the vote as a sign of progress.
[5]
In 2020 the
belted kingfisher
received a majority of student votes as a possible new mascot.
[6]
In September 2020 the University Senate overwhelmingly endorsed the kingfisher as the new mascot, voting 105 to 2 with 4 abstaining.
[7]
Support is building on campus and among alumni for the kingfisher,
[8]
but as of December, 2022 some alumni are opposed to the new mascot, and several online petitions continue to advocate for the return of Chief Illiniwek.
[9]
Supporters of Chief Illiniwek sometimes object to the use of the term "mascot", and instead refer to the Chief as a "symbol" of the university.
[10]
Background
[
edit
]
Chief Illiniwek and the Chief Illiniwek logo—a stylized front view of an American Indian face and headdress—are trademarks of the University of Illinois. Licensed use of the logo by the university has been increasingly restrictive as a result of the ongoing controversy. Chief Illiniwek is not based on an actual American Indian chief, nor did a historical figure with this name ever exist.
Since he performed many of the functions of other schools' mascots, Chief Illiniwek is generally referred to as the university's
mascot
in media reporting and academic sources regarding the controversy.
[11]
Chief Illiniwek predates the use of mascots by most sports teams, adding strength to the claim that the portrayal was never a mascot at all.
[12]
In the final years he did not perform at road games, since other Big Ten universities refused to allow the character to perform at their home games, citing him as offensive.
[13]
During sporting events, Chief Illiniwek was portrayed by a student selected via audition and wearing authentic
Lakota
(Sioux) clothing. The portrayal also included a dance that originated from the first three portrayers' experience in the
Boy Scouts of America
, as taught by
Ralph Hubbard
, who had traveled widely in Europe and America staging "Indian pageants".
[14]
This dance corresponded to the music and lyrics of the "Three in One" performed by the university band, which is an arrangement of three original songs entitled "The March of the Illini", "
Hail to the Orange
", and "Pride of the Illini".
[15]
History
[
edit
]
The origin of Chief Illiniwek dates to 1926, when Ray Dvorak, assistant director of bands at the University of Illinois, conceived the idea of having a Native American
war dance
performed during
halftime
of Illinois football games. The first performance occurred on October 30, 1926 at
Memorial Stadium
during the halftime of a game against the
University of Pennsylvania
. At the conclusion of his performance, Illinwek was met at midfield by a drum major dressed as the
University of Pennsylvania's Quaker
mascot, offered a peace pipe, and walked off the field arm in arm.
[2]
Student Lester Leutwiler, an
Eagle Scout
, created the original costume and performed the dance based upon his experience as a
Boy Scout
. The expression Illiniwek (meaning "the complete human being - the strong, agile human body, and the indomitable human spirit")
[16]
was first used in conjunction with the University of Illinois football team by football coach
Bob Zuppke
, referring to the
Illinois Confederation
[17]
of Native Americans who historically had inhabited much of present-day
Illinois
.
Another student, A. Webber Borchers, was the only Chief to ride on horseback around the field
[2]
and solidified the Chief tradition, continuing the performances and soliciting contributions for a permanent costume in 1930. Since then, the costume has been replaced several times, most recently in 1982. The current costume was sold to the university marching band by
Frank Fools Crow
, chief of the
Oglala Sioux
(a nation unrelated to the Illiniwek), after being sewn by his wife. He visited the campus in 1982 to present the regalia during halftime of a football game at the request of then-Assistant Director of Bands and Director of Athletic Bands Gary Smith. The costume contained real
eagle
feathers, but because eagle feathers are sacred to Native Americans, and because they came from a species protected by the
Lacey Act of 1900
,
[18]
the
Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act
(1940), the
Migratory Bird Act
, and at that time the
Endangered Species Act
, the feathers in the headdresses worn by the Chief were replaced with dyed
turkey
feathers after requests from the family of Chief Fools Crow.
[19]
A total of 36 different students officially performed the role of the Chief. All but one have been men: one woman, Idelle (Stith) Brooks, served in 1943 due to the shortage of male students during
World War II
; she was called "Princess Illiniwek." No student portraying Chief Illiniwek was of American Indian heritage during the 82 year span,
[20]
although Brooks, a journalism major who had grown up on the
Osage Reservation
in
Fairfax, Oklahoma
, was described as an "honorary princess of the Osage Indian tribe".
[21]
[22]
Brooks weighed 90 pounds and her Chief regalia weighed 50.
[2]
The actual descendants of the Illiniwek opposed the Chief (see
Controversy
, below). Whereas, when in May 1995, a
WICD
reporter interviewed members of the
Peoria
Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, Chief Don Giles said, "We do not have a problem with the mascot.",
[23]
by 2000, the tribal council, under a new chief, passed a resolution opposing the use of the Chief by the university.
[24]
On January 17, 2007, the executive committee of the
Oglala Sioux
Tribal Council, issued a resolution asking that the University of Illinois return the regalia to the family of Frank Fools Crow and cease the use of the Chief Illiniwek mascot. The resolution was delivered to the university's board of trustees, UI President B. Joseph White, and Chancellor Richard Herman. The campus' Native American House was authorized by the Oglala Sioux to distribute the resolution to the public.
[25]
The Chief appeared at the university's
homecoming
parade and
pep rally
until 1991.
[2]
Controversy
[
edit
]
From the mid-1970s, the Chief was the subject of debate at the University of Illinois.
[16]
In October 1989,
Charlene Teters
, a graduate student from the
Spokane tribe
, began protesting the Chief at athletic events after her young son and daughter's reaction to the Chief's dance at a basketball game.
[26]
Soon, individuals and organizations, some from outside of the university, began to support the Chief's elimination. Some academic departments adopted official stances in favor of retirement of the mascot. External organizations including the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
, the
National Education Association
,
Amnesty International
, the
Modern Language Association
, and
Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas
also took positions in favor of retiring the Chief.
[27]
In November 1989, the
Illinois state legislature
passed a resolution in support of the Chief.
[2]
Student and alumni organizations, such as the Honor the Chief Society and Chief Illiniwek Educational Foundation, are dedicated to explaining and preserving the tradition of Chief Illiniwek. The Students for the Chief group formed in 1990.
[2]
Among the national Native American organizations which called for the retirement of the mascot were the
National Congress of American Indians
and the
National Indian Education Association
. At the Urbana-Champaign campus, the Native American House, the American Indian Studies program, and the Native American student organizations all called for its retirement.
Chief Illiniwek with the University of Illinois
Marching Illini
Those in favor of retiring the Chief contended that the Chief
misappropriates and misrepresents Native American culture
and perpetuates
harmful racial and ethnic stereotypes
. They argued that this obstructed the creation of a diverse and tolerant learning community, harmed the reputation of the university, and promoted an inaccurate image of Native Americans. Those in support of the mascot claimed that he was a revered symbol representing not only a proud people but the great spirit of a great university.
A 1995 ruling by the
United States Department of Education
found that the mascot did not violate Native American students'
civil rights
. Also in 1995, the state legislature approved a bill making the Chief the "official symbol" of the university, but Governor
Jim Edgar
's amendatory veto allowed the decision to remain with the university.
[2]
On January 13, 2000, the board of trustees of the University of Illinois passed a resolution concerning the issue of the continuation of the Chief Illiniwek performances at its athletic events. The resolution acknowledged the existence of a controversy.  Pursuant to this resolution, the board retained
Louis B. Garippo
, a former circuit court judge in Cook County, to assist in conducting a dialogue on Chief Illiniwek. The Special Intake Session on Chief Illiniwek was held in Foellinger Auditorium on the Urbana campus on April 14, 2000. Garippo presided over the session, reviewed and compiled communications on the issue, and prepared a report
[28]
to the board. Garippo's task was to convey respondents' opinions to the board, not to make a recommendation on the status of Chief Illiniwek.
In 2006, the University Board of Trustees opted to study the issue and passed a resolution calling for "a consensus conclusion to the matter of Chief Illiniwek." Many on both sides of the issue found this resolution problematic, given that former trustee Roger Plummer determined that a compromise on the issue was not possible. At that point, the board of trustees had not consulted on the matter with the faculty of the American Indian Studies Program.
In the past few years, opinion polls on the subject have not been much help in defining Native American opinion on the subject. In 2002, a Peter Harris Research Group poll of those who self-declared Native American ethnicity on a U.S. census showed that 81% of self-identified Native Americans support the use of Indian nicknames in high school and college sports, and 83% of Native Americans support the use of Indian mascots and symbols in professional sports. However, the methods and results of this poll have been disputed.
[29]
A separate poll conducted by the Native-run newspaper
Indian Country Today
in 2001 reported that 81% of those polled "indicated use of American Indian names, symbols and mascots are predominantly offensive and deeply disparaging to Native Americans."
A non-binding student referendum on Chief Illiniwek was conducted in March 2004. Of the approximately one-third of the student body who cast ballots, 69% of the voters favored retention of the Chief.
[30]
Faculty have tended to be critical of the Chief.
[16]
[31]
Another non-binding student referendum on Chief Illiniwek was conducted in February 2008. Of the approximately 23% of the student body who cast ballots, 79% (7,718) voted to show support for Chief Illiniwek, while 21% (2,052) voted to not show support.
[32]
Position of the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma
[
edit
]
The
Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma
are the closest living descendants of the
Illinois Confederation
, having been relocated to Oklahoma in the 19th century. The position of the tribal leadership has evolved over the years.  In a television interview with
WICD-TV
in 1995, Don Giles, then Chief of the Peoria Tribe, said, "To say that we are anything but proud to have these portrayals would be completely wrong. We are proud. We're proud that the University of Illinois, the flagship university of the state, a seat of learning, is drawing on that background of our having been there. And what more honor could they pay us?" Supporting Chief Giles was another tribal elder,
Ron Froman
, who stated that the protesters "don't speak for all Native Americans, and certainly not us."
[16]
Ron Froman was later elected Chief, by which time his views on the Chief Illiniwek mascot had changed. In April 2000, following meetings with American Indian students attending the university, the tribal council, with Chief Froman's support, passed by the margin of 3 to 2 a resolution requesting "the leadership of the University of Illinois to recognize the demeaning nature of the characterization of Chief Illiniwek, and cease use of this mascots [sic]".
[24]
Froman said, "I don't know what the origination was, or what the reason was for the university to create Chief Illiniwek. I don't think it was to honor us, because, hell, they ran our (butts) out of Illinois."
[33]
This puts Chief Illiniwek in a position different from that of the mascots of other schools such as
Florida State University
, whose American Indian mascots are not opposed by the leadership of the corresponding tribes. In 2005, a new Chief, John P. Froman, when asked his position by the NCAA, indicated that "the Chief was not representative of our tribe and culture, mainly because the costume is Sioux."
[34]
In 2006, in response to a widely published column by journalist
George Will
in support of the mascot's use, he wrote a letter reiterating the Peoria Tribe's opposition to the mascot and decrying that the "University of Illinois has ignored the tribe's request for nearly five years."
[35]
NCAA involvement
[
edit
]
Main article:
NCAA Native American mascot decision
In August 2005, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association
, the primary governing board for intercollegiate athletics, instituted a ban on schools that use what they call "hostile and abusive American Indian nicknames" from hosting postseason games, beginning February 2006. The University of Illinois was among the 18 schools subject to the ban which, among other things, prohibited the University from hosting NCAA-sponsored tournaments. The ban was soon expanded to include
Bowl Championship Series
-sponsored bowl games, starting with the 2006 football season. The university appealed the ban in October on the grounds that it violates NCAA bylaws and violated institutional autonomy.
On November 11, 2005, the NCAA, stating that it had "found no new information relative to the mascot, known as 'Chief Illiniwek' or the logo mark used by some athletics teams that depicts an American Indian in feathered headdress,"
[36]
upheld the ban on the University of Illinois. However, it did allow the continued use of the nicknames "Illini" and "
Fighting Illini
" by the university because they are based on the name of the state and not of American Indian descent. The university appealed the decision again on January 30, 2006, mere days before the deadline.
[37]
While the NCAA Executive Committee granted an extension to April 28, the committee's next meeting, to other schools affected by the ban, the University of Illinois requested a longer stay until May 15, the end of the current semester. The executive committee ignored the request for a longer stay and denied the university's second appeal while indicating that no further appeals would be entertained.
[38]
The
Chicago Sun-Times
reported on August 31, 2006 that Chief Illiniwek would "no longer be an official university mascot" after the 2006-2007 basketball season. The paper also reported that the ownership of the Chief would be transitioned to an organization called the "Council of Chiefs" and made up of a number of people who have previously portrayed Chief Illiniwek. The next day, however, the university disputed the
Sun-Times
report. University sources confirmed that several former Chiefs had met with university officials to discuss preserving the mascot's tradition but stated that the so-called "Council of Chiefs" did not exist as a formally organized group. A University spokesman stated that "no decisions have been made" regarding the mascot's fate.
[39]
Chief Illiniwek and the Fighting Illini
[
edit
]
Some have incorrectly linked Chief Illiniwek with the nickname Fighting Illini. Though many assume that both are based on Illinois'
American Indian
traditions, the name
Illini
was first associated with the school by the student newspaper, which in 1874 changed its name from
The Student
to
The Illini
.
[40]
The addition of the adjective "fighting" originated about five years before the appearance of Chief Illiniwek, as a tribute to Illinois soldiers killed in
World War I
. Similarly, the on-campus football venue, Memorial Stadium, was named in honor of those fallen soldiers. As stated above, the NCAA has exempted the names "Illini" and "Fighting Illini" from its ban on American Indian imagery, as these names are purely based on the name of the state, and not a  Native American tribe.
The state of Illinois was named by
French explorers
after the indigenous
Illiniwek people
, a
consortium
of
Algonquian
tribes which thrived in the area.
The word
Illiniwek
or
iliniwek
is the plural form of
ilinwe
and means "those who speak in the ordinary way," although it has often been mistranslated as "tribe of superior men."
[41]
Retiring Chief Illiniwek
[
edit
]
On February 16, 2007, Lawrence Eppley, chair of the board of trustees issued a unilateral ruling retiring Chief Illiniwek.
[42]
Chief Illiniwek's last performance, by the final Chief, Dan Maloney of
Galesburg, Illinois
, took place on February 21, 2007 at the last men's home basketball game of the 2006-2007 regular season against Michigan, in
Assembly Hall
.
[43]
As at the time, Chief Illiniwek also performed at women's home basketball games, the first halftime performance without the portrayal of Chief Illiniwek was the following night, February 22, 2007, at the women's basketball game against Michigan State.
On March 13, 2007, the University of Illinois board of trustees voted to retire Illiniwek's name, image and regalia.
[44]
In February 2007, the National Congress of American Indians thanked the university and commended them for retiring Chief Illiniwek.
[45]
After retirement
[
edit
]
On October 4, 2009, the University of Illinois gave the Chief Illiniwek regalia to the Oglala Lakota. The media were denied entry to this event, which was called a "private function" by associate director of athletics Dana Brenner. The university did not offer a public statement about the return.
[46]
Students and fans still chant "Chief" during the performance of Three In One during halftime. Since neither the NCAA nor the university have any control over what the fans chant, opposition groups have called to additionally ban the Three In One performance.
[47]
In April 2014, an indigenous student, Xochitl Sandoval, sent a letter to the university administration (which she also posted on her Facebook page) describing her thoughts of suicide resulting from the daily insults she felt due to the continued presence of "The Chief" on campus, including other students wearing the old image and name on sweatshirts and the continued "unofficial" performances by the current "Chief", Ivan A. Dozier. She stated that these thoughts came as a result of her feeling that she had no recourse because the university had not enforced its own policies regarding racism and the creation of a hostile environment for indigenous students such as herself; but had instead stated her only recourse would be personal action.
[48]
Soon afterward there was a gathering on the Quad organized by the president of the Native American Indigenous Student Organization in support of Sandoval, and calling for further action by the university to eliminate the presence of the Chief on campus.
[49]
The Campus Faculty Association (CFA) also issued a statement in support of Sandoval.
[50]
In May 2016, the university announced that a process was underway to select a "first-ever athletic mascot" for the university—the phrase evidently recognizing the argument by some Chief supporters that the Chief was not a mascot but a "symbol."
[51]
In August 2017, University Chancellor Robert Jones made the decision to ban the school's "War Chant", in response to critic claims that said the music stereotyped Native Americans and prolonged the divisive debate over Chief Illiniwek.  ""Debating it was not going to do anything but kind of re-initiate a lot of the agony and the angst that have been a cancer that has been eating away at this university for more than a decade," Jones said of the closed-session ruling.
[52]
Later in 2017, a protest interrupted the school's homecoming parade in response to the Unofficial chief marching with the Honor the Chief Society. Though touted as “peaceful”, both the Chancellor and the Chief portrayer were escorted away by police after an officer was assaulted on the hood of the Chancellor’s car. As of 2017, no one had been charged or held responsible.
[53]
The following morning, a number of members of one Sioux nation hosted a powwow on campus bearing a banner reading "The Fighting Sioux Support the Fighting Illini".  These performers were part of an organization known as NAGA (Native American Guardians Association). "...the idea is to educate, not eradicate, and the idea is to improve what you have but never give up the opportunity to teach about Native Americanism." said Andre Billeaudeaux, executive director of NAGA.
[54]
Proposed replacement mascots
[
edit
]
The belted kingfisher has been proposed as a replacement mascot
[55]
UIUC has not yet selected a replacement. A non-binding resolution to make "Alma Otter" the official mascot was placed on the spring 2019 student election ballot, but failed to receive a majority, although some saw the vote as a sign of progress.
[56]
In 2020 the
belted kingfisher
received a majority of student votes as a possible new mascot.
[57]
In September 2020 the University Senate overwhelmingly endorsed the kingfisher as the new mascot, voting 105 to 2 with 4 abstaining.
[58]
The
belted kingfisher
, a bird local to Illinois whose female is orange and blue, has been proposed as a replacement mascot. The kingfisher as a mascot has been endorsed by the
American Indian Center
of Chicago, the
Chicago Tribune
editorial board, and the Champaign
Audubon Society
.
[9]
In December 2022, the
National Congress of American Indians
endorsed efforts to find a replacement mascot, though the kingfisher was not explicitly mentioned.
[9]
Supporters of the Kingfisher have dubbed the bird "naturally true to the orange and blue."
[59]
In February 2023, the
Association on American Indian Affairs
endorsed adopting a new mascot, saying, “Retiring harmful imagery is commendable but not formally replacing that imagery allows for stereotypes to continue and fails to give the University community a new identity that is truly representative of them.”
[60]
In July 2023, the
Native American Rights Fund
endorsed the belted kingfisher as a replacement mascot.
[61]
In 2023, a group of students and faculty created a costume for the unofficial kingfisher mascot, and the kingfisher has made appearances on campus.
[62]
[63]
Selection of unofficial chief portrayers
[
edit
]
In April 2008, the "Council of Chiefs", a group of previous Chief Illiniwek performers, named a student to portray the chief, although this portrayal is not sanctioned or endorsed by the university.
[64]
Logan Ponce, a Latino student, was chosen as the 37th portrayer.  Ponce expressed the ultimate goal of returning the Chief to the university.  "It's unique to Illinois and has been such an important part of our history," he said. "It's part of our heritage. We look forward to continuing it."
[65]
In May 2010 the Students for Chief Organization chose a new student to serve as the 38th chief portrayer: Ivan A. Dozier, who is of Cherokee ancestry.
[66]
Dozier performed as Chief at the "Next Dance" event over homecoming weekend at the university in 2010. He also appeared in regalia at numerous sporting events throughout the years.
[67]
Bennett Kamps was select to replace Dozier upon his graduation, with an initial appearance in February, 2016.
[68]
The current portrayer is Omar Cruz Aranda.
[69]
Unofficial performances and events
[
edit
]
An event called "Students for Chief Illiniwek Presents: The Next Dance," happened on November 15, 2008 following the football game against Ohio State University, in the
Assembly Hall
. "We want to do this event on a very exciting day for Illini fans and we want it to be a complement to that day's game," said Roberto Martell Jr., former president of Students for Chief Illiniwek and a junior in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
[70]
An open letter was sent forth by the Native American House encouraging the entire university community to speak out against the event.
[71]
On February 26, 2010 the webpage of Students for Chief Illiniwek posted nearly fifty email correspondences, obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act
, of several members of the university administration attempting to prevent the "Next Dance" portrayals. Parties involved include Renee Romano, Anna Gonzalez, Robert Warrior, and then-Chancellor
Richard Herman
. The emails include conversations between Romano and Richard Herman appreciating "the fact that we've been trying to get in the way of allowing the students for the chief to perform a dance in the assembly hall and "trying to think of a reason to deny them access to Assembly Hall on Oct. 2." The revelation of free speech violations by the administrators was criticized by free-speech advocates, including the
Foundation for Individual Rights in Education
, which currently gives the University of Illinois a yellow light rating.
[72]
In October 2012, the Chief made an unsanctioned halftime appearance at Memorial stadium, in the
Homecoming
football game against Indiana.
[73]
In January 2015, an unofficial appearance at Tuscola High School, by former portrayer Ivan A. Dozier, was cancelled. School officials removed the announcement post from social media saying they did not have the time or personnel to address the bad language and personal attacks that were made in the online comments.
[74]
[75]
The School District announced via Twitter that the appearance was cancelled "In order to ensure highest level of student/community safety."
[76]
The Council of Chiefs, Students for Chief Illiniwek, and Honor the Chief Society posted events on Facebook encouraging fans to wear "Chief" gear to the basketball game with Purdue on February 22, 2018. Entitled "Paint the Hall Chief", and started by several female members of the community, the posting prompted the university to request that Facebook remove the events due to copyright infringement of the original Chief Illiniwek logo; which Facebook refused to do because the image used is significantly different than the original, constituting legal "fair use".
[69]
At the game, about 100 protestors assembled at the main entrance to the State Farm Center displaying signs and chanting opposition to the Chief.
[77]
University employee Jay Rosenstein was arrested for allegedly stalking and invasion of privacy after he followed Dozier and the current unofficial portrayer of the Chief into a public bathroom at the Assembly Hall on January 22, 2018, and allegedly recorded them in a state of undress.
[78]
No charges were filed by the states attorney.
[79]
Dozier filed suit against Rosenstein in January 2019; the judge rejected Rosenstein's motion to dismiss and the lawsuit can proceed.
[80]
Chancellor's Commission
[
edit
]
The effort to resolve the controversy by the current chancellor,
Robert J. Jones
has included the work of a committee that issued a report of its "critical conversations" that included over 600 participants representing all sides, which remain sharply divided.
[81]
The chancellor has appointed a Commission on Native Imagery: Healing and Reconciliation to implement the recommendations of the committee.
[82]
In 2019 the Office of the Chancellor issued a report with four goals and recommendations.
Provide closure, healing and reconciliation for stakeholders
- Recommendations include a formal event recognizing the  public retirement of Chief Illiniwek, establishing a plaque or monument outside Memorial Stadium commemorating the history, the original intent of the Chief, and the University’s decision to retire the tradition to better align with current educational perspectives on diversity and inclusion.
Facilitate the establishment of new traditions
- Engaging all key stakeholders in identifying new tradition(s) such as music, symbols, branding, marketing, or a mascot that do not rely upon Native American images or traditions.
Remember the history of the Chief with a focus on both the intent and impact of the tradition
- Development of an historically accurate account documenting the Illini, Fighting Illini, and Chief Illiniwek.
Honor and partner with the Native Nations for whom Illinois is their ancestral home
[83]
Both sides of the debate immediately criticized the report. Pro-chief members of the commission characterized the exclusion of Native American imagery from future traditions as "discriminatory" while opponents view the Chief as a racist past that should be not be commemorated.
[84]
Subsequent to the release of the commission report, several dozen current and former faculty (out of over 2,000 on campus) signed a letter urging the NCAA to once again prohibit the UI from hosting postseason competitions until it “fully complies” with NCAA policies on the use of native imagery in sports. The continued presence of the Chief's image on campus and the use of the nickname "Fighting Illini" were cited as examples of policy violations. Chancellor Jones responded that these were not violations.
[85]
Implementation Plan on Native Imagery
[
edit
]
In December 2020 chancellor Robert J. Jones announced the Implementation Plan on Native Imagery, a set of reforms planned for the following three years.  These included expanding the school's American Indian Studies program, repatriating sacred artifacts to indigenous people, offering in-state tuition to students from federally recognized tribal nations, having a campus historian develop an accurate history of the school's use of Native American symbols, and creating a council to develop new traditions for the student body.  The plan does not address the adoption of a new sports mascot, or the possibility of changing the name of the Fighting Illini sports teams.

The Secrets of the Black Arts
is the debut studio album by Swedish
black metal
band
Dark Funeral
, released in January 1996, by
No Fashion Records
. It was re-released on 31 July 2007, with a bonus disc consisting of the album original recording (digitally re-mixed in April 2007).
The Secrets of the Black Arts
is the only album to feature guitarist Blackmoon, vocalist/bassist Themgoroth and drummer Equimanthorn.
The original recording (15-21 January 1995) was produced by
Dan Swanö
at
Unisound Studios
. According to Blackmoon, he insisted that they re-record the album due to "severely unprofessional production and manner from Mr. Swanö". He continued, "He was overworked and mentally tired when we came to the studio. Also, our then-drummer was not playing as good as he should have. So it ended up crap." The rest of the band was satisfied with the recording, but Blackmoon refused to release the album with that recording. They decided on
The Abyss Studio
and recorded the album that was eventually released to the public.

A music video was shot for "The Secrets of the Black Arts".

4404th Wing (Provisional) F-15C Eagles fly a routine patrol mission over Southern Iraq on April 4, 1998, in support of Operation Southern Watch.
The
4404th Wing (Provisional)
is an inactive
United States Air Force
unit. It was last was assigned to the
Air Combat Command
(ACC), stationed at
Prince Sultan Air Base
,
Saudi Arabia
.
The mission of the 4404th Wing (Provisional) was to serve as the front line defense against possible Iraqi aggression after the
1991 Gulf War
. It enforced United Nations Security Council Resolutions 687, 688, and 949 and protected United States military forces stationed in
Kuwait
, the
United Arab Emirates
and Saudi Arabia. The wing was inactivated on 1 October 1998.
History
[
edit
]
Established by Tactical Air Command at
Prince Sultan Air Base
, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia, to partially replace
provisional air divisions
established during the
1991 Gulf War
. The original assets of the 4404th TFW came from the 4th TFW (Provisional), which had operated during the Gulf War. In June 1991 the wing relocated to
King Abdul Aziz Air Base
, Dahran, where it was officially activated as the
4404th Wing (Provisional)
on 2 August 1991.
From the start of
Operation Southern Watch
, the Wing was structured and manned to carry out a temporary mission, insuring that Iraq complied with the post-
Operation Desert Storm
United Nations sanctions. It later was engaged in (
Operation Provide Comfort
, and later
Operation Northern Watch
were commanded by the
US European Command
(EUCOM)). The 4404th consisted of six provisional groups assigned at nine locations in the
Persian Gulf
region, including Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.
During the 1990s and early 2000s, more than 5,000 airmen made up the wing, manned primarily by airmen who rotated to Saudi Arabia on temporary duty assignments. During
Operation Vigilant Warrior
, the number of personnel peaked at about 7000. However, the wing was manned at minimum levels. This policy was intended to reduce the visibility of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, limit exposure to risk, reduce the impact on Air Force units worldwide from whom the airmen were assigned, and insure that they were fully committed during their short tours of duty. This manning provided little flexibility to respond to changes in threat or mission requirements.
Air Force flying squadrons were assigned as units to the 4404th Operations Group (Provisional) on 15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 90-day rotations depending on the type unit. Air Expeditionary Force III forces that deployed to Qatar from July through August 1996 were under the operational control of the 4404th Wing (Provisional), under the tactical control of either the Commander, Joint Task Force-Southwest Asia or the Commander, Joint Task Force-Rugged Nautilus, but for force protection were under U.S. Liaison Office, Qatar which does not have the command authority to direct force protection actions.
After a terrorist truck bomb killed 19 airmen at Dhahran in June 1996 (
Khobar Towers bombing
), the wing was ordered to move to more secure location within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As a result, it was moved back to Prince Sultan Air Base.
It was inactivated and re-designated as the
363d Air Expeditionary Wing
on 1 October 1998 as part of the implementation of the
Air Expeditionary Force
(AEF) concept.

species
of large
freshwater snail
with an
operculum
, an
aquatic
gastropod
mollusk
in the family Ampullariidae, the applesnails.
Original description
[
edit
]
Pomacea haustrum
was originally described under the name
Ampullaria haustrum
by
Lovell Augustus Reeve
in his book
Conchologia Iconica
, in 1856.
[1]
In Reeve's original text, (the
type description
) reads as follows:
Species 23. (Mus.
Cuming
.)
AMPULLARIA HAUSTRUM. Amp. testâ compressè
ovatâ, ventricosissimâ, vix umbilicatâ, spirâ
parvâ, subimmersâ, anfractibus ad suturam
impressè canaliculatis, deinde convexis; sordidè
olivaceâ, striatâ et malleatâ, fasciis angustis
pallidè virescentibus cingulatâ; aperturâ
pyrifomi-oblongâ, peramplâ; fauce livida-
purpureâ.
THE SCOOP AMPULLARIA. Shell compressly ovate,
very ventricose, scarcely umbilicated, spire small,
rather immersed, whorls impressly channelled at
the suture, then convex; dull olive, striated and
malleated, encircled with narrow faint green
bands; aperture pyriformly oblong, very large;
livid purple in the interior.
Hab.
River Maranon
, Brazil.
This fine species belongs to the same type as
A. insularum
, D ́Orbigny, from
La Plata
. Its chief points
of difference consist in being less distinctly umbilicated,
and in having a much larger and more expanded aperture.
It is difficult to identify even the general region of the
type locality
for this species.
[2]
The type locality was given as the
Río Marañón
, Brazil, but this river is in Peru, joining with the
Rio Ucayali
above
Iquitos
to become the
Rio Solimões
, which in turn joins with the
Rio Negro
to become the
Amazon River
of Brazil.
[2]
Some of the first Europeans to
explore the region in the sixteenth century
, however, referred to the Amazon River as El Río Marañón, and some nineteenth century maps refer to the entire Amazon as the Marañón.
[2]
It is likely that the Río Marañón of one collector was not the same as the Río Marañón of another.
It was considered a synonym of
Pomacea canaliculata
by Thompson (1997)
[3]
based on shell morphology, but tentatively retained as a separate species by Cowie & Thiengo,
[4]
because of its reported production of green eggs.
[2]
Phylogenetic analyses by Rawlings et al. (2007) confirmed its species status.

Distribution
[
edit
]
The indigenous distribution of
Pomacea haustrum
is
Bolivia
,
Brazil
and
Peru
in South America.
[5]
[2]
The nonindigenous distribution includes the United States:
Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge
waters in Palm Beach County, Florida.
[2]
Pomacea haustrum
were discovered in the late 1970s in Palm Beach County Florida, and have not spread appreciably in 30 years.
[2]
This is the only known area where this species is established in the United States.
[2]
The initial introduction in the United States was probably from aquarium release, aka "aquarium dumping".
[5]
Pomacea haustrum
is currently of relatively minor concern in the U.S., given its failure to spread beyond Palm Beach County after 30 years or more in Florida.
[2]
However, many species have maintained limited distributions, sometimes for decades, before becoming invasive.

[5]
Life cycle
[
edit
]
Populations of
Pomacea haustrum
in Florida produce bright green egg masses consisting of individual eggs approximately 3-5 mm in size compressed into polygonal shapes, giving the egg mass an irregular honeycombed appearance.
[2]
Since other
Pomacea
species also produce green eggs, this character is insufficient to verify this species as
Pomacea haustrum
.
[2]
It lays its eggs in clutches above the water level.

Four reclosers on the right side of a substation
In
electric power distribution
,
automatic circuit reclosers
(
ACRs
) are a class of
switchgear
designed for use on overhead electricity distribution networks to detect and interrupt transient
faults
. Also known as
reclosers
or
autoreclosers
, ACRs are essentially rated
circuit breakers
with integrated current and voltage sensors and a
protection relay
, optimized for use as a protection asset. Commercial ACRs are governed by the
IEC
62271-111/IEEE Std C37.60 and IEC 62271-200 standards.
[1]
[2]
The three major classes of operating maximum voltage are 15.5 kV, 27 kV and 38 kV.
For overhead electric power distribution networks, up to 80% of faults are transient, such as
lightning strike
,
surges
or foreign objects coming into contact with exposed distribution lines. Consequently, these transient faults can be resolved by a simple reclose operation.
[3]
Reclosers are designed to handle a brief open-close duty cycle, where
electrical engineers
can optionally configure the number and timing of attempted close operations prior to transitioning to a lockout stage.
[4]
The number of reclose attempts is limited to a maximum of four by recloser Standards noted above.
At two multiples of the rated current, the recloser's rapid trip curve can cause a trip (off circuit) in as little as 1.5 cycles (or 30 milliseconds). During those 1.5 cycles, other separate circuits can see voltage dips or blinks until the affected circuit opens to stop the fault current. Automatically closing the breaker after it has tripped and stayed open for a brief amount of time, usually after 1 to 5 seconds, is a standard procedure.
[5]
Reclosers are often used as a key component in a
smart grid
, as they are effectively computer controlled switchgear which can be remotely operated and interrogated using
SCADA
or other
communications
. Interrogation and remote operation capabilities allow utilities to aggregate data about their network performance, and develop automation schemes for power restoration. Automation schemes can either be distributed (executed at the remote recloser level) or centralized (close and open commands issued by a central utility
control room
to be executed by remotely controlled ACRs).
Description
[
edit
]
Autoreclosers are made in single-phase
[6]
and
three-phase
versions, using oil,
vacuum
, or
SF
6
interrupters. Controls for the reclosers range from the original electromechanical systems to digital electronics with
metering
and
SCADA
functions. The ratings of reclosers run from 2.4-38 kV for load currents from 10-1200 A and fault currents from 1-16 kA.
[7]
[8]
On a
3-phase
circuit, a recloser is more beneficial than three separate
fuse cutouts
. For example, on a
wye
to
delta
conversion, when cutouts are used on the wye side and only 1 out of 3 of the cutout fuses open, some customers on the delta side have a
low voltage
condition, due to voltage transfer through the
transformer windings
. Low voltage can cause severe damage to electronic equipment. But when a recloser is used, all three phases open, thereby eliminating the problem.
[9]
History
[
edit
]
Reclosers were invented in the mid 1900s in the USA with the earliest reclosers introduced by Kyle Corporation in the early 1940s.
[10]
Reclosers were originally oil-filled
hydraulic
devices with rudimentary mechanical-protection-relaying capabilities. Modern automatic circuit reclosers are significantly more advanced than the original hydraulic units. The advent of
semiconductor
based electronic protective relays in the 1980s resulted in increased recloser sophistication, allowing for differing responses to the various cases of abnormal operation or fault on an electric power distribution network. The high-voltage insulation and interrupting devices in modern reclosers typically consist of
solid dielectric
insulation with
vacuum interrupters
for current interruption and arc quenching.
[11]
[12]
Purposes for Electric Power Distribution Network
[
edit
]
A Recloser installed on a Rural Feeder
Protection during fault conditions
[
edit
]
To prevent electric power distribution network damage, each station along the network is protected with
circuit breakers
or
fuse cutouts
which turn off power in the event of a
short circuit
. These protection solutions present a major problem when restoring power immediately following transient events, because repair crews need to manually reset the circuit breakers or replace fuses cutouts.
Alternatively, reclosers are programmed to automate the reset process remotely after a short circuit and allow a more granular approach to service restoration, resulting in increased
availability
of supply. Using reclosers during a transient fault, for instance, a tree limb blown off a tree during a windstorm that lands on the power line and quickly clear itself as the limb falls to the ground, allows power to be remotely restored.
Remote restoration
[
edit
]
Reclosers can save significant
operational expenditure
when operated remotely, as they can reduce the need of field crews to travel to site to reset devices which have transitioned to lockout.
Division
[
edit
]
Reclosers can also address electric power distribution network damage by dividing up the network into smaller sections, possibly at every electric power distribution downstream branch point, which handle much less power than the breakers at the feeder stations, and can be set to trip at much lower power levels. Consequently, a single event on the grid will cut off only the section handled by a single recloser, long before the feeder station would notice a problem and cut power.
Reconfiguration and Load flow resolution
[
edit
]
Reclosers can resolve
load flow
issues by reconfiguring the electric power distribution network.
Typical fault conditions & reclosing principles
[
edit
]
The basic philosophy of reclosing is to actively consider the fault types and provide an effective response based on probabilities of the detected fault type. Fault currents are sensed by
current sensing
transformers
.
Lightning
[
edit
]
The primary class of fault type on an overhead distribution network is lightning strike. Lightning surges increase voltage which can cause localised breakdown of insulation, allow arcing over insulators. Reclosers can detect this as an overcurrent or earth fault (depending on the asymmetry of the fault). Lightning surges pass very quickly (reduce in 50ms), so the first reclose can be configured to both trip and reclose quickly. This first reclose allows for interruption of the arcing caused by lightning, but restores the power quickly.
Vegetation contact or equipment failure
[
edit
]
If after the first, swift reclose, the recloser closes onto a fault, it is likely that the fault is a secondary class of fault, vegetation contact or equipment failure. An overcurrent fault would indicate a line to line class fault, which can be confirmed by negative phase sequence overcurrent protection, whereas an earth fault can indicate a Line to Ground or Double Line to Ground fault. Reclosers can then apply a fuse burning policy, where they remain closed for a short period to allow fuses on lateral lines to burn, isolating the fault. If the fault is not cleared, the recloser trips open again. This same policy can be used to deliver energy to fault sites to burn the fault off the line. This could be a branch crossing between multiple lines, or fauna (birds, snakes, etc.) coming into contact with the conductors.
Sensitive Ground Fault / Sensitive Earth Fault
[
edit
]
Sensitive earth fault protection in reclosers is typically set to immediate lockout. This detection of small leakage currents (less than 1 ampere) on a medium voltage line can indicate insulator failure, broken cables or lines coming into contact with trees. There is no merit in applying reclosing to this scenario, and the industry best practice is not to reclose on sensitive earth fault. Reclosers with sensitive earth fault protection capable of detecting 500mA and below are used as a fire mitigation technique, as they provide an 80% risk reduction in fire starts,
[13]
however they are never to be used as reclosers in this application, only as single shot distributed circuit breakers which allow for sensitivity to verify the existence of these faults.
[14]

Applications
[
edit
]
Traditional reclosers were designed simply to automate the action of a line crew visiting a remote distribution site to close a tripped circuit breaker and attempt to restore power. With the advanced protection functionality of modern reclosers, these devices are used in a multitude of additional applications

Smart Grid Distribution Network Automation
Centralised or Distributed
Centralised Automation requires remote communication through SCADA or otherwise. Distributed Automation can be configured at the Recloser Controller
Renewable Connection
Modern Recloser Controllers use ANSI 25 Synchrocheck, 59N Neutral Voltage Displacement, Synchrophasors, ANSI 25A Auto-Synchronisor and other voltage protection
Voltage Sensing on both sides of Recloser
Substation Circuit Breakers
Using Reclosers installed in a Substation where peak fault currents do not exceed the maximum rated interrupting capacity, usually only Rural Substations
Typically maximum bus fault currents below 16 kA
Single Wire Earth Return Network Protection
SWER network design topology is discouraged in modern electrical engineering due to safety reasons, but due to cost savings it is sometimes deployed. Single Phase Reclosers can be used to improve safety on these lines during fault events.
Single Phase Recloser
Single Phase Laterals Overcurrent Protection
As a key overcurrent protection element on single phase laterals, a North American network style design. 3 Single Phase units can be combined into a "Single Triple" arrangement, where single phase reclosing can improve reliability to unfaulted phases during transient fault events. Despite the ability to lock single phases with a "Single Triple" arrangement during a permanent fault on one phase, the risk of circulating currents is high and typically a 3 phase lockout is implemented.
Single Triple Recloser or Single Phase Recloser System
Mobile Mining Equipment Protection
Reclosers can be used to protect three phase mining equipment. These devices are occasionally mounted in mobile kiosks that can be moved as the equipment is moved around the mine site. Design complexity of protection equipment is reduced in these applications, as reclosers include all protection and control required to meet the application; which reduces testing and commissioning costs of the equipment.

Autoreclosers in action
[
edit
]
Residential customers in areas fed by affected
overhead power lines
can occasionally see the effects of an autorecloser in action. If the fault affects the customer's own distribution circuit, they may see one or several brief, complete outages followed by either normal operation (as the autorecloser succeeds in restoring power after a transient fault has cleared) or a complete outage of service (as the autorecloser exhausts its maximum 4 retries).
If the fault is on an adjacent circuit to the customer, the customer may see several brief "dips" (sags) in voltage as the heavy fault current flows into the adjacent circuit and is interrupted one or more times. A typical manifestation would be the dip, or intermittent black-out, of domestic lighting during an electrical storm. Autorecloser action may result in electronic devices losing time settings, losing data in volatile memory, halting, restarting, or suffering damage due to power interruption. Owners of such equipment may need to protect electronic devices against the consequences of power interruptions and also power surges.
Sectionalizer Integration
[
edit
]
Reclosers may cooperate with down-stream protective devices called sectionalizers, usually a
disconnector
or
cutouts
equipped with a tripping mechanism triggered by a counter or a timer.
[17]
A sectionalizer is generally not rated to interrupt fault current however it often has a larger Basic Insulation Level, allowing some sectionalizers to be used as a point of isolation. Each sectionalizer detects and counts fault current interruptions by the recloser (or circuit breaker). After a pre-determined number of interruptions, the sectionalizer will open, thereby isolating the faulty section of the circuit, allowing the recloser to restore supply to the other non-fault sections.
[18]
Some modern recloser controllers can be configured to have reclosers operate in sectionalizer mode. This is used in applications where protection grading margins are too small to provide effective protection co-ordination between electrical assets.
Fire safety and wildfires
[
edit
]
Fire risk is an innate risk of an overhead distribution network. Regardless of the choice of distribution protection switchgear, the fire risk is always higher with overhead conductors than with underground transmission.
[13]
The Victorian Royal Commission into the 2009 bushfires indicated that reclosing must be disabled on high bushfire risk days, however on low risk days it should be applied for reliability of supply.
[14]
Incorrectly configured or old model reclosers have been implicated in the starting or spread of wildfires. Research into the Australian 2009 Black Saturday Bushfires indicated that reclosers operating as single shot circuit breakers with Sensitive Ground Fault protection configured at 500mA would reduce fire start risk by 80%. Any form of reclosing should be removed on high fire risk days, and reclosing in general should not be applied to detected Sensitive Earth Fault faults.
[13]
Victorian utilities responded to the Royal Commission by converting some of their overhead network in high risk areas to underground cable, replacing exposed overhead conductors with insulated cables, and replacing old reclosers with modern ACRs with remote communications to ensure that settings can be adjusted on high bushfire risk days.

Bilateral relations
Bolivia-Chile relations
Bolivia
Chile
International relations
between the Republic of
Chile
and the Plurinational State of
Bolivia
have been strained ever since independence in the early 19th century because of the
Atacama border dispute
. Relations soured even more after Bolivia lost its coast to Chile during the
War of the Pacific
and became a
landlocked country
(Bolivia still claims a corridor to the Pacific Ocean). Chile and Bolivia have maintained only consular relations since 1978, when territorial negotiations failed and Bolivia decided to sever diplomatic relations with Chile. However, in spite of straining relationship, Chile and Bolivia still have economic treaties supporting tourism and cooperation; therefore, trading between two nations is not affected by the territorial dispute.
Historical relations

Atacama border dispute
Relations following independence from Spain (1818-1828)
[
edit
]
When
Chile
and
Bolivia
gained independence from Spain in 1818 and 1825 respectively, both countries established their borders using the
uti possidetis
principle. The origins of the dispute came from the borders established in the
Spanish Empire
that just defined the Atacama desert as the northern border of the
Captaincy General of Chile
. Bolivian and Chilean historians disagree on whether the territory of
Charcas
, originally part of the
Viceroyalty of Peru
, later of the
Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata
and ultimately of Bolivia, included access to the sea. Supporting their claims with different documents, Bolivians claim that it did, while Chileans disagree. When
Simón Bolívar
established Bolivia as a nation in 1825, he claimed access to the sea at the port of
Cobija
, disregarding overlapping claims by Chile, which claimed that it bordered Peru at the
Loa River
and that Bolivia was therefore
landlocked
.
Santa Cruz and the War of the Confederation (1829-1839)
[
edit
]
Main article:
War of the Confederation
Andrés de Santa Cruz
became President of Bolivia in 1829 and intervened militarily in
Peru
, leading to the creation of the
Peru-Bolivian Confederation
in 1836. Chilean minister
Diego Portales
perceived the confederation as a threat to Chilean interests and the balance of power in the region. Chile declared war in 1836 followed by
Argentina
in 1837; both countries were supported by Peruvian dissidents. The war began with victories by the Confederation over its enemies. A turning point took place on the fields of Paucarpata where the Peru-Bolivian Confederation led by Santa Cruz forced the Chilean and Peruvian rebel armies to sign the peace treaty known as the Paucarpata Treaty, which included their unconditional surrender; later this treaty was rejected by the Chilean parliament. The Peruvian rebels and the Chilean army set off on a new campaign against Santa Cruz, defeating the Confederation on the
fields of Yungay
. The confederation was dissolved in 1839. This was a turning point in Bolivian history because, for nearly 60 years afterwards, coups and short-lived constitutions dominated Bolivian politics.
Border and economic treaty (1866-1874)
[
edit
]
Bolivian-Chilean national borders had not been agreed upon until 1866, when the two countries had negotiated a treaty
[1]
that established the
24th parallel south
as their boundary. In Chile, the territories recognised as Bolivian on the Pacific coast were seen as ceded, while in Bolivia they were seen as finally recognised by Chile as Bolivian. This treaty also entitled Bolivia and Chile to share tax revenue on mineral exports out of the territory between the
23rd
and
25th parallels
. The area between the 25th and 23rd parallels would also remain demilitarized. A second treaty in 1874 superseded this, entitling Bolivia to collect full tax revenue between the 23rd and 24th parallels, but fixed tax rates on Chilean companies for 25 years.
[1]
At the time, most economic exploitation of the coastal region was being conducted by Chilean companies and British interests under the aegis of Chile's more robust economy and more stable institutions. Bolivia subsequently became dissatisfied at the arrangement due to the negative financial status of the national budget, especially after the earthquakes that struck
Cobija
in
1868
and
1877
. This was the only small coastal town founded by Bolivians.

War of the Pacific
In 1879, Bolivian dictator General
Hilarión Daza
increased the taxes on the exportation of saltpeter in violation of the 1866 treaty. When Chilean-owned saltpeter companies refused to pay, Daza expropriated the companies and sold them in a public auction. Daza then put an end to all commerce with Chile and exiled all Chilean residents in Bolivia (the Bolivian port of
Antofagasta
had more Chileans than Bolivians). In response, Chile declared the border treaties null and reactivated its old claim that Chile had inherited a land border with Peru using the
uti possidetis
principle. Chile disembarked troops at Antofagasta the day of the auction. Later, Chile declared war on Bolivia and occupied Bolivia's coast. Peru had, in 1873, signed a secret pact with Bolivia in which the two countries agreed to fight together against any nation that threatened either of them. When Peru refused to be neutral in the conflict between Chile and Bolivia, Chile declared war on Peru. Chile defeated both countries and annexed the coast claimed by Bolivia. This was ratified by Peru in the
Treaty of Ancón
(1883) and by Bolivia in a
Treaty of Peace and Friendship
signed in 1904.

Further negotiations (1964-1978)
[
edit
]
Diplomatic relations with Bolivia continued to be strained because of Bolivia's continuing aspiration to have access to the sea. In 1964, Bolivian President
Víctor Paz Estenssoro
severed diplomatic relations with Chile. Generals
Augusto Pinochet
and
Hugo Banzer
resumed diplomatic relations and attempted to settle the territorial disputes. Secret negotiations started in 1973, and in 1975 diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were established. That year, Pinochet and Banzer met in the Bolivian border town of
Charaña
. Pinochet agreed to give Bolivia a small strip of land running between the Chilean city of
Arica
and the
Peruvian
border. However the Treaty of Lima between Peru and Chile specified that Chile must consult Peru before granting any land to a third party in the area of
Tarapacá
. Peruvian President General
Francisco Morales Bermúdez
did not agree with the Charaña proposal and instead drafted his own proposal, in which the three nations would share administration of the port of Arica and the sea immediately in front of it. Pinochet did not agree to this proposal, and Banzer broke ties with Chile again in 1978. The failure of the Charaña accords was one of the reasons for Banzer's downfall that very year.
Since the 1990s

Bolivian gas conflict
[

See also:
Bolivian gas conflict
In early 2002, the administration of President
Jorge Quiroga
proposed to build a pipeline through neighboring
Chile
to the port of
Mejillones
, the most direct route to the
Pacific Ocean
to export Bolivia's newly discovered gas reserves. However, antagonism towards Chile ran deep in Bolivia because of the loss of Bolivia's Pacific coastline to Chile in the
War of the Pacific
(1879-1884).
Bolivians began campaigning against the Chilean option, arguing instead that the pipeline should be routed north through the
Peruvian
port of
Ilo
, 260 km further from the gas fields than Mejillones, or, better yet, first industrialised in Bolivia. According to Chilean estimates, the Mejillones option would be $600 million cheaper.
Peru, however, claimed the difference in cost would be no more than $300 million. Bolivian proponents of the Peruvian option said it would also benefit the economy of the northern region of Bolivia through which the pipeline would pass.
Supporters of the Chile pipeline argued that US financiers would be unlikely to develop processing facilities within Bolivia. Meanwhile, the Peruvian government, eager to promote territorial and economic integration, offered Bolivia a special economic zone for 99 years for exporting the gas at Ilo, the right of free passage, and the concession of a 10 km
2
area, including a port, that would be exclusively under Bolivian administration. President Jorge Quiroga postponed the decision shortly before leaving office in July 2002 and left this highly contentious issue to his successor. It was thought that Quiroga did not want to jeopardize his chances of re-election as president in the 2007 elections.
After winning the 2002 presidential election,
Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada
expressed his preference for the
Mejillones
option but made no "official" decision. Despite this, a
consortium
called Pacific LNG was formed to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the British companies
BG Group
and
BP
, and Spain's
Repsol YPF
. Repsol is one of three companies that dominate the gas sector in Bolivia. The other two are
Petrobras
and
Total
.
[2]
A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn up to build a pipeline to the Pacific coast, where the gas would be processed and
liquefied
before being shipped to Mexico and the United States (
Baja California
and
California
) through a Chilean port, for example
Tocopilla
. Lozada's 2003 deal was heavily opposed by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalistic resentment against Chile, and the Gas War led to Lozada's resignation in October 2003.
Lozada's successor,
Carlos Mesa
, held a
gas referendum
with the question: "Do you agree with President Carlos Mesa's policy of using gas as a strategic resource to achieve a sovereign and viable route of access to the Pacific Ocean?" The referendum was approved with 54.79% of the votes saying "yes". Mesa even took the question about a sea access to the
OAS
where he had a discussion with Chilean president
Ricardo Lagos
, who said that it was a bilateral topic. Mesa resigned following the 2005 Hydrocarbons Law.
Evo Morales
, who was elected president in 2005, is strongly opposed to having a foreign consortium export Bolivia's natural gas without processing it domestically. He argued it should be used domestically to help Bolivia, the poorest country in South America.
Chile and Bolivia maintain consular relations and appear to have become friendlier.
[
when?
]
Former Chilean President
Ricardo Lagos
attended the inauguration of Bolivian President
Evo Morales
. In 2015, Morales announced his intention to establish conditional diplomatic relations with Chile in order to achieve Bolivia's aspiration for sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean via Chilean land. Chile, on the other hand, wants unconditional diplomatic relations.
[

The dispute with Chile was taken to the
International Court of Justice
. The Court ruled in support of the Chilean position, and declared that although Chile may have held discussions about a Bolivian corridor to the sea, the country was not required to negotiate one or to surrender its territory.

Wikipedia founders

(right)
Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.
[18]
Wikipedia began as a complementary project for
Nupedia
, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.
[19]
It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of
Bomis
, a
web portal
company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO
Jimmy Wales
and
Larry Sanger
,
editor-in-chief
for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.
[1]
[20]
Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia
Open Content
License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the
GNU Free Documentation License
at the urging of
Richard Stallman
.
[21]
Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,
[22]
[23]
while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a
wiki
to reach that goal.
[24]
On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.
[25]
Launch and growth
The
domains
wikipedia.com
(later redirecting to
wikipedia.org
) and
wikipedia.org
were registered on January 12, 2001,
[26]
and January 13, 2001,
[27]
respectively. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001
[19]
as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,
[28]
and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.
[22]
The name originated from a
blend
of the words
wiki
and
encyclopedia
.
[29]
[30]
Its integral policy of "neutral point-of-view"
[31]
was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.
[22]
Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit.

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia,
Slashdot
postings, and web
search engine
indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.
[35]
[36]
Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The
English Wikipedia
passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the
Yongle Encyclopedia
made during the
Ming dynasty
in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.
[37]
Citing fears of commercial
advertising
and lack of control, users of the
Spanish Wikipedia
forked from Wikipedia to create
Enciclopedia Libre
in February 2002.
[38]
Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from
wikipedia.com
to
wikipedia.org

Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.
[41]
Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.
[42]
A team at the
Palo Alto Research Center
attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.
[43]
Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called "
low-hanging fruit
"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.
[44]
[45]
[46]
In November 2009, a researcher at the
Rey Juan Carlos University
in
Madrid
, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.
[47]
[48]
The Wall Street Journal
cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.
[49]
Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.
[50]
Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable".
[51]
A 2013
MIT Technology Review
article, "The Decline of Wikipedia", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.
[52]
In July 2012,
The Atlantic
reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.
[53]
In the November 25, 2013, issue of
New York
magazine, Katherine Ward stated, "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis."
[54]
The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.
[55]

Milestones
Cartogram
showing number of articles in each European language as of January 2019.
One square represents 10,000 articles. Languages with fewer than 10,000 articles are represented by one square. Languages are grouped by language family and each language family is presented by a separate color.
In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten
most popular websites
in the United States, according to
Comscore
Networks.
[57]
With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing
The New York Times
(#10) and
Apple
(#11).
[57]
This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.
[58]
In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month.
[59]
On February 9, 2014,
The New York Times
reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion
page views
and nearly 500 million
unique visitors
a month, "according to the ratings firm comScore".
[7]
As of March 2023
, it ranked 6th in popularity, according to
Similarweb
.
[60]
Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through "
stigmergic
accumulation".
[61]
[62]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the
United States Congress
—the
Stop Online Piracy Act
(SOPA) and the
PROTECT IP Act
(PIPA)—by
blacking out its pages for 24 hours
.
[63]
More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.
[64]
[65]
In January 2013,
274301 Wikipedia
, an
asteroid
, was named after Wikipedia;
[66]
in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the
Wikipedia Monument
;
[67]
and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as
Print Wikipedia
.
[68]
In April 2019, an Israeli
lunar lander
,
Beresheet
, crash landed on the surface of the
Moon
carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.
[69]
[70]
In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into
synthetic DNA
.
[71]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for
The Economic Times
indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it "had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent."
[72]
Varma added, "While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's
Knowledge Graphs
project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users."
[72]
When contacted on this matter,
Clay Shirky
, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's
Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society
said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further]."
[72]
By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.
[73]
As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,
[74]
from which
cloud computing
was the most cited page.
[75]
On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called "Vector 2022".
[76]
[77]
It featured a redesigned
menu bar
, moving the
table of contents
to the left as a
sidebar
, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.
[77]
[78]
The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the
Swahili Wikipedia
unanimously voted to revert the changes.
[76]
[79]
Openness
Differences between versions of an article are highlighted
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the
procrastination
principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.
[80]
Restrictions
Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.
[81]
On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.
[82]
[83]
A frequently vandalized article can be "semi-protected" or "extended confirmed protected", meaning that only "autoconfirmed" or "extended confirmed" editors can modify it.
[84]
A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only
administrators
can make changes.
[85]
A 2021 article in the
Columbia Journalism Review
identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as "perhaps the most important" means at its disposal to "regulate its market of ideas".
[86]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the
German Wikipedia
maintains "stable versions" of articles which have passed certain reviews.
[87]
Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending changes" system in December 2012.
[88]
Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.
[89]
Wikipedia's editing interface
Review of changes
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.
[note 6]
[90]
On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a "watchlist" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.
[91]
"New pages patrol" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.
[92]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low
transaction costs
of participating in a
wiki
created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored "creative construction" over "creative destruction".
[93]
Vandalism
Main article:
Vandalism on Wikipedia
Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.
[94]
Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.
[95]
American journalist
John Seigenthaler
(1927-2014), subject of the
Seigenthaler incident
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.
[96]
[97]
However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.
[98]
In the
Seigenthaler biography incident
, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure
John Seigenthaler
in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the
assassination of John F. Kennedy
.
[98]
It remained uncorrected for four months.
[98]
Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of
USA Today
and founder of the Freedom Forum
First Amendment Center
at
Vanderbilt University
, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.
[99]
[100]
After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research tool".
[98]
The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.
[101]
Edit warring
Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as "edit warring".
[102]
[103]
It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,
[104]
and criticized as creating a competitive
[105]
and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine
gender roles
.
[106]
[107]
Taha Yasseri
of the
University of Oxford
examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.
[108]
[109]
Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of
counterproductive work behavior
at Wikipedia. He relied instead on "mutually reverting edit pairs", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles
George W. Bush
,
anarchism
, and
Muhammad
.
[109]
By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering
Croatia
,
Scientology
, and
9/11 conspiracy theories
.

Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular,
copyright
laws) of the United States and of the US state of
Virginia
, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.
[110]
[111]
By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation
Terms of Use
and
Privacy Policy
; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.
[112]
[113]
In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the "official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation".
[114]
The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the "Five pillars", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.
[115]
The five pillars are:
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view
Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute
Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
Wikipedia has no firm rules
The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.
[116]
Editors can enforce the rules by
deleting
or modifying non-compliant material.
[117]
Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.
[87]
The two most commonly used
namespaces
across all editions of Wikipedia are: The article namespace (which are the articles of the encyclopedia) and the category namespace (which are a collection of pages such as articles). In addition, there have been various books and reading list that are composed completely of articles and categories of a certain Wikipedia.
Content policies and guidelines
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is
encyclopedic
and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.
[118]
A topic should also meet
Wikipedia's standards of "notability"
, which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.
[119]
Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.
[120]
It must not present original research.
[121]
A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.
[118]
Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.
[122]
This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly sourced.
[123]
Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.
[124]
Governance
Wikipedia's initial
anarchy
integrated
democratic
and
hierarchical
elements over time.
[125]
[126]
An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.
[127]
Administrators
Main article:
Wikipedia administrators
Editors in good standing in the community can request extra
user rights
, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for "
adminship
",
[128]
which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.
[129]
Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.
[129]
By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.
[130]
In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.
[131]
Dispute resolution
Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a "request for comment".
[102]
Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in
consensus building
in the field.
[132]
Joseph Reagle
and
Sue Gardner
argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by
Quakers
.
[132]
: 62
A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a
facilitator
in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.
[132]
: 83
Arbitration Committee
Main article:
Arbitration Committee (Wikipedia)
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.
[133]
Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,
[134]
functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.
[133]
Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).
[note 7]
Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).
[133]
Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of
impersonation
and
anti-social behavior
.
[135]
When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.
[133]
Community
Main article:
Wikipedia community
Video of
Wikimania 2005
- an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the
Wikimedia Foundation
, was held in
Frankfurt am Main
, Germany, August 4-8.
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated "talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.
[136]
Wikipedians and
British Museum
curators collaborate on the article
Hoxne Hoard
in June 2010
Wikipedia's community has been described as
cultlike
,
[137]
although not always with entirely negative connotations.
[138]
Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of
credentials
, has been referred to as "
anti-elitism
".
[139]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.
[140]
As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the questions frequently asked there.
[141]
Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization".
[142]
In 2008, a
Slate
magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits."
[143]
This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by
Aaron Swartz
, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.
[144]
The English Wikipedia has
6,740,356
articles,
46,424,820
registered editors, and
121,680
active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.
[145]
Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references".
[146]
Editors who do not log in are in some sense "
second-class citizens
" on Wikipedia,
[146]
as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation",
[147]
but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their
IP addresses
cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.
[147]
Studies
A 2007 study by researchers from
Dartmouth College
found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site".
[148]
Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that "[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users
... 524 people
... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits."
[142]
However,
Business Insider
editor and journalist
Henry Blodget
showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders".
[142]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,
[149]
although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.
[150]
According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content".
[151]
Diversity
Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.
[152]
Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.
[153]
Similarly, many of these universities, including
Yale
and
Brown
, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.
[153]
Andrew Lih
, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior".

Most edited editions of Wikipedia over time
There are currently 336 language editions of Wikipedia (also called
language versions
, or simply
Wikipedias
). As of November 2023, the six largest, in order of article count, are the
English
,
Cebuano
,
German
,
Swedish
,
French
, and
Dutch
Wikipedias.
[157]
The second and fourth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot
Lsjbot
, which as of 2013
had created about half the articles on the
Swedish Wikipedia
, and most of the articles in the
Cebuano
and
Waray Wikipedias
. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (

Since Wikipedia is based on the
Web
and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the
English edition
). These differences may lead to some conflicts over
spelling differences
(e.g.
colour
versus
color
)
[161]
or points of view.
[162]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not
licensed freely
may be used under a claim of
fair use
.
[163]
[164]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language".
[165]
Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).
[166]
For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,
[167]
and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.
[168]
The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.
[168]
It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.
[119]
Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions
[169]
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer "interwiki links", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.
[170]
[171]
A study published by
PLOS One
in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the
English Wikipedia
, and 25% for the
simple English Wikipedia
.
[169]
English Wikipedia editor numbers
On March 1, 2014,
The Economist
, in an article titled "The Future of Wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that "the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years."
[172]
The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by
The Economist
as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).
The Economist
reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.
[172]
In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.

Various
Wikipedians
have
criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation
, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.
[173]
[132]
Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits
systemic bias
. In 2010, columnist and journalist
Edwin Black
described Wikipedia as being a mixture of "truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods".
[174]
Articles in
The Chronicle of Higher Education
and
The Journal of Academic Librarianship
have criticized Wikipedia's "Undue Weight" policy, concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.
[175]
[176]
[177]
Journalists
Oliver Kamm
and
Edwin Black
alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an "ax to grind" on the topic.
[174]
[178]
A 2008 article in
Education Next
Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and
spin
.
[179]
In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that "Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online."
[180]
Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being
ideologically biased
. In February 2021,
Fox News
accused Wikipedia of whitewashing
communism
and
socialism
and having too much "
leftist
bias".
[181]
Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a "propaganda" for the left-leaning "establishment" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.
[182]
In 2022, libertarian
John Stossel
opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.

CBC
, January 15, 2014
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as
Encyclopædia Britannica
are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.
[184]
However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and
Encyclopædia Britannica
by the science journal
Nature
found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies;
Britannica
, about three."
[185]
Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects "a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects."
[186]
Others raised similar critiques.
[187]
The findings by
Nature
were disputed by
Encyclopædia Britannica
,
[188]
[189]
and in response,
Nature
gave a rebuttal of the points raised by
Britannica
.
[190]
In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the
Nature
effort, and suggested a "flawed study design" (in
Nature
'
s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported
confidence intervals
), and a lack of study "statistical power" (i.e., owing to small
sample size
, 42 or 4
× 10
1
articles compared, vs >10
5
and >10
6
set sizes for
Britannica
and the English Wikipedia, respectively).
[191]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.
[192]
Concerns have been raised by
PC World
in 2009 regarding the lack of
accountability
that results from users' anonymity,
[193]
the insertion of false information,
[194]
vandalism
, and similar problems.
Economist
Tyler Cowen
wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.
[195]
Amy Bruckman
has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, "the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created".
[196]
In September 2022,
The Sydney Morning Herald
journalist Liam Mannix noted that, "There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate... And yet it [is]." Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as
Encyclopedia Britannica
, summarizing that, "...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty."
[197]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.
[198]
Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.
[199]
Editors of traditional
reference works
such as the
Encyclopædia Britannica
have questioned the project's
utility
and status as an encyclopedia.
[200]
Wikipedia co-founder
Jimmy Wales
has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of "fake news" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.

Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for
Internet trolls
,
spammers
, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.
[90]
[203]
In response to
paid advocacy editing
and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in
The Wall Street Journal
to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.
[204]
The article stated that: "Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement.
Katherine Maher
, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.
'
"
[204]
[205]
[206]
[207]
[208]
These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by
Stephen Colbert
on
The Colbert Report
.
[209]
Legal Research in a Nutshell
(2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources".
[210]
Discouragement in education
Some university
lecturers
discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in
academic work
, preferring
primary sources
;
[211]
some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.
[212]
[213]
Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.
[214]
Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten
emails
weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said.
[215]
[216]
In February 2007, an article in
The Harvard Crimson
newspaper reported that a few of the professors at
Harvard University
were including Wikipedia articles in their
syllabi
, although without realizing the articles might change.
[217]
In June 2007,
Michael Gorman
, former president of the
American Library Association
, condemned Wikipedia, along with
Google
, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".
[218]
A 2020 research study published in
Studies in Higher Education
argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education "
flipped classroom
", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.

Medical information

Health information on Wikipedia
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for
The Atlantic
magazine in an article titled "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia", stated that "Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information."
[220]
Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of
Amin Azzam
at the
University of San Francisco
to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve
Wikipedia articles on health-related issues
, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by
James Heilman
to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.
[220]
In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in
The Atlantic
titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference."
[221]
Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed."

Notability in the English Wikipedia
and
Criticism of Wikipedia § Systemic bias in coverage
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has
terabytes
of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.
[222]
The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see
deletionism and inclusionism
).
[223]
[224]
Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.
[225]
The "Wikipedia is not censored" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of
images of Muhammad
in the
English edition
of its
Muhammad
article, citing this policy.
[226]
The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the
censorship of Wikipedia
by national authorities in China
[227]
and Pakistan,
[228]
amongst other countries.
[229]
[230]
[231]
Pie chart of Wikipedia content by subject as of January 2008
[232]
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:
[232]
Culture and Arts: 30% (210%)
Biographies and persons: 15% (97%)
Geography and places: 14% (52%)
Society and social sciences: 12% (83%)
History and events: 11% (143%)
Natural and Physical Sciences: 9% (213%)
Technology and Applied Science: 4% (−6%)
Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%)
Health: 2% (42%)
Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%)
Thought and Philosophy: 1% (160%)
These numbers refer only to the number of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its "Wikipedia Loves Libraries" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the
New York Public Library for the Performing Arts
to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.
[233]
A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the
University of Minnesota
indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the "people and arts" category, while males focus more on "geography and science".
[234]
Coverage of topics and bias
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the
Oxford Internet Institute
in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.
[235]
Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.
[236]
An editorial in
The Guardian
in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for
a list of female porn actors
than a
list of women writers
.
[237]
Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in
Cape Town
sought to address.
[155]
Systemic biases
Academic studies of Wikipedia
have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the "average Wikipedian", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15-49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.
[238]
This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.
[239]
[240]
This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias,
gender bias
, and
geographical bias on Wikipedia
.
[241]
[242]
There are two broad types of bias, which are
implicit
(when a topic is omitted) and
explicit
(when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).
[239]
Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.
[241]
In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example "biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare".
[51]
The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's
Technology Review
titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and
policy creep
on the
downward trend in the number of editors
.

Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.
[243]
Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as
feces
,
cadaver
,
human penis
,
vulva
, and
nudity
) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.
[244]
The site also includes
sexual content
such as images and videos of
masturbation
and
ejaculation
, illustrations of
zoophilia
, and photos from
hardcore pornographic
films in its articles. It also has non-sexual
photographs of nude children
.
[245]
The Wikipedia article about
Virgin Killer
—a 1976 album from the German
rock
band
Scorpions
—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked
prepubescent
girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article
Virgin Killer
was blocked for four days by most
Internet service providers
in the United Kingdom after the
Internet Watch Foundation
(IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a "blacklist" it supplies to British internet service providers.
[246]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on
Wikimedia Commons
contained child pornography, and were in violation of
US federal obscenity law
.
[247]
[248]
Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to
pedophilia
and one about
lolicon
, were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the
PROTECT Act of 2003
.
[249]
That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are
obscene under American law
.
[249]
Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.
[250]
Wikimedia Foundation
spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,
[251]
saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it."
[251]
Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted".
[252]
Critics, including
Wikipediocracy
, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.
[253]
Privacy
One
privacy
concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a "private citizen" rather than a "
public figure
" in the eyes of the law.
[254]
[note 8]
It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in
cyberspace
and the right to be anonymous in
real life
. The Wikimedia Foundation's
privacy policy
states, "we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement", and states that "personal information" may be shared "For legal reasons", "To Protect You, Ourselves & Others", or "To Understand & Experiment".
[255]
In January 2006, a German court ordered the
German Wikipedia
shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of
Boris Floricic
, aka "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's
right to privacy
or that of his parents was being violated.
[256]
Wikipedia has a "
Volunteer Response Team
" that uses Znuny, a
free and open-source software
fork of
OTRS
[257]
to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.
[258]
In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.
[259]
Sexism
Main article:
Gender bias on Wikipedia
Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of
sexism
and
harassment
.
[260]
[261]
The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.
[262]
Edit-a-thons
have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.
[263]
In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about
Donna Strickland
due to lack of coverage in the media.
[264]
[265]
Five months later, Strickland won a
Nobel Prize in Physics
"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.
[265]
[266]
Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award
Gérard Mourou
.
[265]
Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for
Quartz
argued that "it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation."
[267]
Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.
[267]
A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of
Stony Brook University
's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of
Carnegie Mellon University
found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. "Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men."

Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the
Wikimedia Foundation
, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as
Wiktionary
and
Wikibooks
.
[269]
The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.
[270]
[271]
The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service
Form 990
shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.
[272]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named
Lila Tretikov
as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.
[273]
The
Wall Street Journal
reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants to be free."
[274]
[275]
The same
Wall Street Journal
article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who "said Tretikov would address that issue (
paid advocacy
) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency
... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities", Walsh said.
[274]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the "superprotection" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,
[276]
Katherine Maher
became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.
[277]
Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to
Bloomberg Businessweek
regarding the harassment issue that: "It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority
... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words."
[154]
Maher served as executive director until April 2021.
[278]
Maryana Iskander
was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.
[279]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called
Wikimedia movement affiliates
. These include
Wikimedia chapters
(which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the
Catalan language
community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.
[280]
Software operations and support
See also:
MediaWiki
The operation of Wikipedia depends on
MediaWiki
, a custom-made,
free
and open source
wiki software
platform written in
PHP
and built upon the
MySQL
database system.
[281]
The software incorporates programming features such as a
macro language
,
variables
, a
transclusion
system for
templates
, and
URL redirection
.
[282]
MediaWiki is licensed under the
GNU General Public License
(GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.
[281]
[283]
Originally, Wikipedia ran on
UseModWiki
written in
Perl
by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required
CamelCase
for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.
[284]
Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a
PHP wiki
engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by
Magnus Manske
. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the
exponentially increasing
demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
Lee Daniel Crocker
.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.
[285]
In April 2005, a
Lucene
extension
[286]
[287]
was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on
Elasticsearch
.
[288]
In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a
WYSIWYG
(What You See Is What You Get) extension,
VisualEditor
, was opened to public use.
[289]
[290]
[291]
It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and buggy".
[292]
The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.
[293]
Automated editing
Main article:
Wikipedia bots
Wiki translation AI
Computer programs called
bots
have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.
[294]
[295]
[296]
One controversial contributor,
Sverker Johansson
, created articles with his bot
Lsjbot
, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.
[297]
Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).
[298]
Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.
[295]
Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or
IP address
ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the
MH17 jet
incident in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.
[299]
Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.
[300]
According to
Andrew Lih
, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.
[301]
Hardware operations and support
See also:
Wikimedia Foundation § Hardware
As of 2021,
page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of
Varnish
caching servers and back-end layer
caching
is done by
Apache Traffic Server
.
[302]
Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the
Linux Virtual Server
software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.
[302]
The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.
[303]
Overview of system architecture as of April 2020
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated
clusters
of
Linux
servers running the
Debian
operating system.
[304]
As of February 2023,
caching clusters are located in
Amsterdam
,
San Francisco
,
Singapore
, and
Marseille
.
[111]
[305]
By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an
Equinix
facility in
Ashburn, Virginia
.
[306]
[307]
In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in
Singapore
, the first of its kind in Asia.
[308]
In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France.
[309]
Internal research and operational development
Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,
[52]
the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of
industrial organization
economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.
[310]
Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the "Thank" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.
[52]
[292]
The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by
Adam Jaffe
, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.
[311]
At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,
[312]
the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.
[311]
In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,
[313]
updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.
[311]
Internal news publications
Main article:
The Signpost
Multiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper
The Signpost
was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.
[314]
[315]
The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and
Wikipedia's sister projects
.
[316]
Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the
Wikiworld
webcomic,
[317]
the Wikipedia Weekly podcast,
[318]
and newsletters of specific
WikiProjects
like
The Bugle
from WikiProject Military History
[319]
and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors.
[320]
There are also several publications from the
Wikimedia Foundation
and multilingual publications such as Wikimedia Diff
[321]
and
This Month in Education
.
[322]
Wikipedia Library
The Wikipedia Library
For information for Wikipedia editors, see
Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library
.
The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of
digital publications
, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.
[323]
[324]
Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when
ICE Publishing
joined in 2020, a spokesman said "By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources - creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers."
[325]
Access to content
"Accessing Wikipedia" redirects here. For our accessibility guidelines, see
Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility
.
Content licensing
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the
GNU Free Documentation License
(GFDL), a
copyleft
license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.
[326]
The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with
free software
programs licensed under the
GPL
. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.
[327]
In December 2002, the
Creative Commons license
was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.
[328]
Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
Free Software Foundation
(FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.
[329]
In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.
[330]
[331]
[332]
[333]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under
fair use
doctrine,
[334]
while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in
Japanese copyright law
). Media files covered by
free content
licenses (e.g.
Creative Commons
'
CC BY-SA
) are shared across language editions via
Wikimedia Commons
repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.
[335]
Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.
[336]
The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.
[337]
[338]
Methods of access
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.
[339]
The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.
Thousands of "
mirror sites
" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are
Reference.com
and
Answers.com
.
[340]
[341]
Another example is
Wapedia
, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.
[342]
Some web
search engines
make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include
Microsoft Bing
(via technology gained from
Powerset
)
[343]
and
DuckDuckGo
.
Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on
optical discs
. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.
[344]
The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,
[345]
the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,
[346]
and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.
[347]
Additionally, "Wikipedia for Schools", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and
SOS Children
, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.
[348]
There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.
[349]
[350]
Since 2009, tens of thousands of
print-on-demand
books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company
Books LLC
and by three
Mauritian
subsidiaries of the German publisher
VDM
.
[351]
The website
DBpedia
, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.
[352]
Wikimedia has created the
Wikidata
project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable
semantic
format,
RDF
.
[353]
As of February 2023,
it has over 101 million items.
[354]
WikiReader
is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by
OpenMoko
and first released in 2009.
[355]
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a
web crawler
is discouraged.
[356]
Wikipedia publishes "
dumps
" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,
there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.
[357]
Wikimedia Enterprise
is a for-profit solution to this.
[358]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the
Journal of Documentation
, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library
reference desk
, with an accuracy of 55 percent.
[359]
Mobile access

and
Help:Mobile access
A mobile version showing the English Wikipedia's Main Page, on August 3, 2019
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard
web browser
through a fixed
Internet connection
. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the
mobile web
since July 2013,
The New York Times
on February 9, 2014, quoted
Erik Möller
, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry.
[7]
The article in
The New York Times
reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."
[7]
The New York Times
reports that Möller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by
The New York Times
for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.
[7]
Bloomberg Businessweek
reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013, with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.
[360]
At the time of the appointment of new Wikimedia Foundation executive Lila Tretikov, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Soon after, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including
BlackBerry
and the
Windows Phone
system, making market share a secondary issue.
[275]
The Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.
[361]
[362]
The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.
[363]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the
Wireless Application Protocol
(WAP), via the
Wapedia
service.
[342]
In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the
iPhone
,
Android
-based devices, or
WebOS
-based devices.
[364]
Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia
metadata
like
geoinformation
.
[365]
[366]
Wikipedia Zero
was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.
[367]
[368]
It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.
[367]
Andrew Lih
and
Andrew Brown
both maintain editing Wikipedia with
smartphones
is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.
[369]
[370]
Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,
[369]
and Tom Simonite of
MIT Technology Review
claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some
Wikipedians
use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the
status quo
.
[52]
Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.
[369]
[370]
Chinese access
Access to the
Chinese Wikipedia
has been
blocked
in
mainland China
since May 2015.
[15]
[371]
[372]
This was done after Wikipedia started to use
HTTPS
encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.
[373]
Copycats
Russians have developed clones called
Runiversalis
[374]
and
Ruwiki
.
[375]
Iranians have created a new website called wikisa.org.
[376]
Cultural influence
Trusted source to combat fake news
In 2017-18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.
[12]
[13]
Noam Cohen
, writing in
The Washington Post
states, "YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out '
fake news
'."
[13]
[377]
Readership
In February 2014,
The New York Times
reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month,
... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors."
[7]
However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.
[378]
The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.
[379]
In addition to
logistic growth
in the number of its articles,
[380]
Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.
[381]
The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.
[382]
The
Pew
Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.
[383]
In 2011,
Business Insider
gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.
[384]
According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.
[385]
As of February 2023,
Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion
pageviews
each month.

COVID-19 pandemic
Main article:
Wikipedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic
During the
COVID-19 pandemic
, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.
[386]
[387]
[388]
[389]
Noam Cohen wrote in
Wired
that Wikipedia's effort to combat
misinformation related to the pandemic
was different from other major websites, opining, "Unless
Twitter
,
Facebook
and
the others
can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet."
[387]
In October 2020, the
World Health Organization
announced they were freely licensing its
infographics
and other materials on Wikimedia projects.
[390]
There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.
[391]
[392]
Cultural significance

[395]
The
Parliament of Canada
's website refers to Wikipedia's article on
same-sex marriage
in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the
Civil Marriage Act
.
[396]
The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the
World Intellectual Property Organization
[397]
—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.
[398]
Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some
US intelligence agency
reports.
[399]
In December 2008, the scientific journal
RNA Biology
launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the
RNA family
for publication in Wikipedia.
[400]
Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,
[401]
[402]
often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for
plagiarizing from Wikipedia
.
[403]
[404]
[405]
[406]
In 2006,
Time
magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with
YouTube
,
Reddit
,
MySpace
, and
Facebook
) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.
[407]
On September 16, 2007,
The Washington Post
reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the
2008 US election campaign
, saying: "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day."
[408]
An October 2007
Reuters
article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.
[409]
One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when
Italian
politician
Franco Grillini
raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of
freedom of panorama
. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.

Wikipedia, an introduction -
Erasmus Prize
2015
Jimmy Wales
accepts the 2008
Quadriga
A Mission of Enlightenment
award on behalf of Wikipedia
A working group led by
Peter Stone
(formed as a part of the
Stanford
-based project
One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence
) in its report called Wikipedia "the best-known example of crowdsourcing
... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth".
[411]
[412]
In a 2017 opinion piece for
Wired
,
Hossein Derakhshan
describes Wikipedia as "one of the last remaining pillars of the
open
and
decentralized web
" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with
social media
and
social networking services
, the latter having "since colonized the web for television's values". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the
Age of Enlightenment
tradition of
rationality
triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers "endangered" due to the "gradual shift from a
typographic
culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment". Rather than "
sapere aude
" (
lit.
'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of "dare not to care to know". This is while Wikipedia faces "a more concerning problem" than funding, namely "a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to "save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know."
[413]
Awards
Wikipedia team visiting the Parliament of Asturias
Wikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony
Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.
[414]
The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual
Prix Ars Electronica
contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges'
Webby Award
for the "community" category.
[415]
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?"
[416]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received
Quadriga
A Mission of Enlightenment
award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with
Boris Tadić
,
Eckart Höfling
, and
Peter Gabriel
. The award was presented to Wales by
David Weinberger
.
[417]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual
Erasmus Prize
, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,
[418]
and the Spanish
Princess of Asturias Award
on International Cooperation.
[419]
Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony,
Jimmy Wales
praised the work of the
Asturian Wikipedia
users.

Satire
See also:
Category:Parodies of Wikipedia
Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.
Comedian
Stephen Colbert
has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show
The Colbert Report
and coined the related term
wikiality
, meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on".
[209]
Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in
The Onion
,
[421]
as well as the 2010
The Onion
article "'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today".
[422]
In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy
The Office
, office manager (
Michael Scott
) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on
negotiation
tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.
[423]
Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.
[424]
"
My Number One Doctor
", a 2007 episode of the television show
Scrubs
, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which
Perry Cox
reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the
raw food diet
reverses the effects of
bone cancer
by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the
Battlestar Galactica
episode guide
.
[425]
In 2008, the comedy website
CollegeHumor
produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.
[426]
The
Dilbert
comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia."
[427]
In July 2009,
BBC Radio 4
broadcast a comedy series called
Bigipedia
, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.
[428]
Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.
[429]
On August 23, 2013, the
New Yorker
website published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?"
[430]
The cartoon referred to
Chelsea Elizabeth Manning
(born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently
come out
as a
trans woman
.
[431]
In December 2015,
John Julius Norwich
stated, in a letter published in
The Times
newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia "at least a dozen times a day", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as "a work of reference as useful as any in existence", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.
[432]
Sister projects - Wikimedia
Main article:
Wikimedia project
Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the
Wikimedia Foundation
. These other
Wikimedia projects
include
Wiktionary
, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,
[433]
Wikiquote
, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,
[434]
Wikibooks
, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,
[435]
Wikimedia Commons
, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,
[436]
Wikinews
, for collaborative journalism,
[437]
and
Wikiversity
, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.
[438]
Another sister project of Wikipedia,
Wikispecies
, is a catalogue of all species, but is not open for public editing.
[439]
In 2012,
Wikivoyage
, an editable travel guide,
[440]
and
Wikidata
, an editable knowledge base, launched.
[441]
Publishing
A group of Wikimedians of the

at the US National Archives
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like
Encyclopædia Britannica
, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.
[442]
[443]
[444]
Nicholas Carr
's 2005 essay "The amorality of
Web 2.0
" criticizes websites with
user-generated content
(like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote, "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the
hegemony
of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening."
[445]
Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications.
Chris Anderson
, the former editor-in-chief of
Wired
, wrote in
Nature
that the "
wisdom of crowds
" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top
scientific journals
with rigorous
peer review
processes.
[446]
Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen
BookScan
stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping "far more sharply".
[447]
Kathryn Hughes
, professor of
life writing
at the
University of East Anglia
and author of two biographies wrote, "The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?"
[447]
Research use
Wikipedia has been widely used as a
corpus
for linguistic research in
computational linguistics
,
information retrieval
and
natural language processing
.
[448]
[449]
In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the
entity linking
problem, which is then called "wikification",
[450]
and to the related problem of
word-sense disambiguation
.
[451]
Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.
[452]
In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the
University of Franche-Comté
in
Besançon
and Dima Shepelyansky of
Paul Sabatier University
in
Toulouse
published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.
[453]
[454]
[455]
They used
PageRank
,
CheiRank
and similar algorithms "followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)".
[455]
[456]
The study was updated in 2019.
[457]
A 2017
MIT
study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.
[458]
[459]
Studies related to Wikipedia have been using
machine learning
and
artificial intelligence
[412]
to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism
[460]
[461]
and
data quality
assessment in Wikipedia.
[462]
[463]
In February 2022,
civil servants
from the UK's
Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities
were found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of the
Levelling Up White Paper
after journalists at
The Independent
noted that parts of the
document
had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on
Constantinople
and the
list of largest cities throughout history
.
[464]
Related projects
Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986
BBC Domesday Project
, which included text (entered on

computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.
[465]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.
Everything2
),
[466]
with many later being merged into the project (e.g.
GNE
).
[467]
One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was
h2g2
, which was created by
Douglas Adams
in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.
[468]
Subsequent collaborative
knowledge
websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional
peer review
, such as
Encyclopedia of Life
and the online wiki encyclopedias
Scholarpedia
and
Citizendium
.
[469]
[470]
The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.

Heath
, is a Japanese musician and singer-songwriter. He is best known as bass guitarist of the rock band
X Japan
. He joined the group in August 1992, replacing
Taiji Sawada
who left earlier in the year. Heath stayed with X Japan until their dissolution in 1997 and reunited with the band in 2007.
After X Japan's breakup he focused on his solo career. In 2000, he founded Dope HEADz with X Japan guitarist

and former

1986-2006: Early bands, X Japan, solo career and other work
[
edit

Heath at X Japan's concert at
Madison Square Garden
, 2014.
Heath's first known band was the heavy metal group Paranoia which he joined in 1986 as bassist.
[1]
They released one album in 1987 before splitting up, with vocalist Nov moving on to the
thrash metal
band
Aion
. In 1988 Heath joined Sweet Beet as vocalist for a year. In 1990 he moved to Tokyo, got introduced to
hide
of
X
through a mutual friend, and attended their
Nippon Budokan
concert.
[1]
In 1991 Heath played at Extasy Summit '91, an event put on by X drummer
Yoshiki
's
Extasy Records
, with a band called Majestic Isabelle. In April 1992 he joined Sweet Death, whom he had previously played with in 1990. Sweet Death was a band produced by Extasy, that same year the band's new leader Kiyoshi (who years later joined Spread Beaver), decided to change their name to Media Youth. Heath did not stay with them long, because in May hide invited him to join
X Japan
after a rehearsal with the band.
[1]
In June he left Media Youth and on August 24, 1992, at a press conference in New York at
Rockefeller Center
, it was announced that he had joined X.
[2]
His first concert with them was the October 1992 Extasy Summit, and the following year they released
Art of Life
, which topped the
Oricon
chart.
[2]
[3]
However, that year the members of X Japan took a break to start solo projects.
Dahlia
, which would become the band's last album, was released on November 4, 1996, and once again, it reached the number one spot.
[3]
In September 1997, it was announced that X Japan would disband. They performed their farewell show, aptly titled "The Last Live", at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997.
In 1995, Heath released his self-titled first solo album. His second,
Gang Age Cubist
, followed in 1998. For the 1999 hide tribute album,
Tribute Spirits
, Heath teamed up with X Japan guitarist
Pata
and former Spread Beaver percussionist/programmer I.N.A. to cover the song "Celebration".
[4]
He reunited with them in 2000 when they formed Dope HEADz, adding vocalist Jo:Ya. They released two singles and an album in 2002 when they recruited new singer Shame and released
Planet of Dope,
but ceased activity soon after its release.
On December 29, 2003, the bassist announced a new project called Rats, but after the release of their re-recording of Heath's "Traitor", the project was ended on August 29, 2004. That same year he formed a band called Lynx, with
Der Zibet
vocalist Issay, but they did not release any recordings.
[5]
In 2005, Heath restarted his solo activities after a seven-year hiatus.
2007-present: X Japan reunion
[
edit
]
Heath at
Lollapalooza
in 2010
According to a report by the newspaper
Sponichi
, X Japan vocalist
Toshi
visited drummer
Yoshiki
in Los Angeles in November 2006 to work on a song as a tribute to hide.
[6]
In March 2007, Toshi announced on his website that he and Yoshiki had recently resumed working together, stating that a "new project" would commence soon.
[7]
Rumors of a X Japan reunion subsequently began, and in June Yoshiki was reported as having expressed interest in a tour and that he was in talks with Heath and Pata regarding their participation.
[6]
On October 22, 2007,
X Japan
announced their reunion and released the
Saw IV
theme song, "
I.V.
".
[8]
In mid-March 2009, it was reported in the media that Heath was having issues with his personal management agency, that X Japan's concerts in South Korea on the 21st and 22nd were cancelled as a result, and that the bassist might leave the band.
[9]
On April 20, Heath's offer to withdraw from X Japan was confirmed to
Sankei Sports
, but it was not accepted by bandleader Yoshiki.
[10]
The day before their May 2009 Tokyo Dome concerts, Heath explained that he was questioning who he was as an artist, but decided to stay in the band after talking to Yoshiki.
[11]
In 2010, X Japan went on their first North American tour from September 25 to October 10.
[12]
Their first world tour began with four gigs in Europe from June 28 to July 4, 2011, and was resumed from September to October with five shows in South America and five in Asia.
[13]
[14]
[15]
In response to the
2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
that occurred in Japan on March 11, Heath supported X Japan vocalist Toshi in eight concerts throughout western Japan. All of the shows were acoustic in support of nationwide
power conservation efforts
and also featured
Luna Sea
's
Shinya
and the
Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa
. All proceeds were donated to the
Japanese Red Cross
to aid the victims.

Realizing that she can save the town from Croatoan, Audrey must work closely with him to make a great sacrifice. Nathan makes it back to Haven with the help of Dwight, who was led to him by a ghostly Duke. Audrey and Nathan's reunion is cut short when Croatoan accidentally knocks Nathan with an aether spear. Audrey lashes out at him and asks if he would ever make the same sacrifice Nathan just did. Realizing how far he's fallen, Croatoan revives Nathan and consents to go into the Barn and end the Troubles. Vince reveals that the Aether in Croatoan isn't enough and that a catalyst is needed to charge the new barn with love. Audrey agrees to go back into the Barn with them, saying goodbye to Nathan forever and extracting the Troubles from everyone around the world. A month later, Gloria tells Nathan the genetic markers Charlotte discovered are gone from everyone she's tested: the Troubles are finally gone for good. As Nathan heads out for a day off, he is stunned to meet "Paige" and her son James broken down by the side of the road, Audrey and the Colorado Kid apparently returned to him. In the Barn, Vince explains to Croatoan that while it was impossible to let her out as Audrey, it was a simple matter for her to come back as someone else, knowing that no matter who she is, she and Nathan would fall in love again. However, this time around both will be able to have the life they hoped to have, with them being able to raise their son themselves.
Production
[
edit
]
On January 28, 2014, Syfy ordered a 26-episode fifth season. This season was split up into two half-seasons due to an increase in the Canadian budget that brought to a total of $28 million instead of the usual $14 million for a single season.
[20]
The first 13 episodes aired in late 2014 while the remaining 13 aired in late 2015.
[1]
Production for both parts lasted from April 22, 2014 to December 2014.
Originally set to join lead-in
WWE Smackdown
on Thursdays after both shows were moved from Friday nights, the first half of season 5 was moved to 8/7c at the last minute due to the delay of
Smackdown
before returning to Fridays at 7/6c before
Smackdown
and
Z Nation
.
[2]
Unlike the first half, the second half returned to its 10/9c slot where it once again aired after
Smackdown
on Thursdays.
Laura Mennell was cast as worldly scientist Charlotte Cross (formerly Erin Reid) who uncovers a possible cure to the Troubles.
[21]
Eric Balfour confirmed
Emma Lahana
's departure due to family emergency, leading to her character being written off, a fate that was revealed in "Speak No Evil" even though she was originally not going to be killed.
[22]
Kris Lemche
[23]
and Jason Priestley returned to guest star. In addition, Adam "Edge" Copeland's real-life best friend (and former WWE tag team partner)
Jay "Christian" Reso
guest starred for one episode and is slated to appear in a couple more in the second half.
[24]
William Shatner appeared in the second half of season 5 in a pivotal role that has the potential to forever impact the fate of the town of Haven and its troubled residents.
[6]
[25]
It was announced that Lucas Bryant would make his directorial debut in the seventeenth episode of the season, originally titled "Look" before it was changed to "Enter Sandman".
[26]
Showrunner and executive producer
Gabrielle Stanton
explained that the team was already prepared for the end after they filmed both parts of the fifth season in 2014 when
Haven
'
s cancellation was announced in August 2015, but promised that the final episode would satisfy fans. She also said that they looked at the remaining thirteen episodes as if it is indeed the last because they didn't want to leave it on a giant cliffhanger just in case
Haven
isn't coming back.
[27]
However, a year prior to the cancellation, season five being the show's last was first hinted by Eric Balfour when he told TVLine that one of the producers was considering about shooting two different endings at the time production was still filming.
[28]
The show's Canadian channel
Showcase
premiered the mid-season premiere episode "New World Order" at the 2015
Fan Expo Canada
on September 7, 2015 a month prior to its public premiere.

The
SS
Metallurg Baykov
(
Russian
:
Металлург Байков
) was a
tweendecker
freighter
with steam turbine engines and the second
Leninsky Komsomol-class cargo ship
(Project 567). The merchant ship belonged to the
Black Sea Shipping Company
in the
Soviet Union
,
[3]
and was named in honor of
metallurgist
Alexandr Baykov
(in Russian)
.
Background
[
edit
]
Project 567 was developed at the Chernomorsudoproekt Central Design Bureau (CDB ChSP) in
Nikolayev
.
[3]
K. I. Bohonevich was the chief designer until 1956, and B. K. Sidorov took over until 1961. All ship specifications are similar to those of the
SS
Leninsky Komsomol
, the first ship in the
Leninsky Komsomol
class.
History
[
edit
]
Construction and early voyages
[
edit
]
In 1959, despite the Kherson Shipyard's delivery of four
tankers
and the
SS
Leninsky Komsomol
, the shipyard's productivity was only 82 percent. Its inability to reach production targets was due to a delay in the construction of the
Metallurg Baykov
. Expected to sign an agreement to begin the ship in 1959, the
Black Sea Shipping Company
only agreed to construction terms on 24 July 1960. The delay was due to a number of design errors, which were remedied in 1959. Logistical issues precluded rapid changes, since the Soviet system prevented the hasty acquisition of equipment from manufacturers.
[4]
According to the
Singapore Free Press
, the
Metallurg Baykov
was at berth 15/16 on 2 November 1960.
[5]
She was briefly mentioned in an article, "Great Labour Victory", in the 14 March 1962 issue of the Soviet newspaper
Одесский портовик
(English:
Odessa Port Workers
): "The turbine ship
Metallurg Baykov
was unloaded 100 hours early".
[6]
Cuban blockade
[
edit
]
The
Metallurg Baykov
's
first voyage to Cuba during the
Cuban blockade
began in early August 1962 from
Novorossiysk
, and she arrived in Cuba on 25 August (
Casablanca
was an announced port of arrival). The ship carried a reported 1,400 tons of cargo, including trucks and cranes on the open deck.
[7]
Her second voyage to Cuba began on 14 September from
Sevastopol
, and the
Metallurg Baykov
arrived in
Casilda
on 30 September.
[7]
The technicians and personnel of the mobile missile base, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel I. V. Shishchenko of the 50th Missile Army, were on the ship.
[8]
[9]
On 14 October, US intelligence detected Soviet missiles in Cuba in an aerial photographic survey.
[10]
Since 18 September, US warships had questioned the cargo aboard Soviet transport ships.
[11]
According to Ivan Shishchenko, captain (a lieutenant-colonel in some sources) of an escort subdivision:
... At three o'clock in the morning on 14 September, the
Metallurg Baykov
cast off from the pier and took the course to the
Bosphorus
. When the ship approached
Istanbul
, the
pilot
boarded the ship. I was worried, a stranger on board, but these are the rules for ships passing through the straits ... On 18 September, two American warships with the numbers 858 and 931 on their sides met us between
Sardinia
and
Tunisia
. One had uncovered guns (the crew was standing by at battle stations) and approached to 80-100 meters. The Americans communicated with
flag signals
:
- What is your ship's destination?
- We are running to
Casablanca
(an answer ordered by ship captain Vasily Gurzhiy).
- What's on board?
- Agricultural machinery.
- Have a good trip.
The American warship 858 turned away and joined ship number 931, one kilometer away. That day, American reconnaissance aircraft circled our ship at an altitude of 2-3 kilometres (6,600-9,800 ft) and returned to its base in
Tunisia
. When our ship passed
Gibraltar
, we received a signal to open an envelope. The envelope contained a form with the name of the actual destination port (
Matanzas
) and information about the politics and government of Cuba and climatic conditions on the island. In 15 minutes, the officers collected the contents of the envelope. US Air Force reconnaissance aircraft again came within sight near the
Azores
. On 28 September, as we approached Cuba, an American cargo ship set a collision course with our ship in violation of the rules of navigation. The watch officer reported to Gurzhiy about the collision threat. He immediately issued an order, the ship turned abruptly and ... the collision was avoided ...
[11]
[12]
[13]
The
Metallurg Baykov
moored at the port of
Casilda
. On 30 September, Soviet ambassador to Cuba Aleksandr Alekseyev ordered the troops ashore. That night the first convoy was sent to
Las Villas province
, accompanied by Cuban motorcyclists who attracted the attention of local residents.
[14]
According to a 16 August 2012 story in the newspaper
Вечерняя Одесса
(
Evening Odessa
), "During the
Cuban Missile Crisis
in 1962, aircraft from the US and other NATO countries made 1,300 flights over our [Soviet] ships. Their ships, maneuvering in close proximity to our ships, provoked collisions and made 75 attempts to stop our ships for inspection on the open sea."

Second-place award in the rifle competition at the first Day of Sea and River Fleet Workers in 1981, signed and stamped with the
Metallurg Baykov
's
stamp by captain I. Shalamay and signed by V. Marushevskiy, the ship's DOSAAF coordinator
The
Day of Sea and River Fleet Workers
was established by Decree of the
Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union
No.
3018-X ("Regarding public holidays and commemorative days") on 1 October 1980 and amended by Decree No. 9724-XI ("Regarding Amendments to the legislation of the USSR regarding holidays and commemorative days") on 1 November 1988.
[16]
The holiday for sea and river-fleet workers in the USSR was celebrated annually on the first Sunday of July.
Rifle-shooting competitions were held periodically on Soviet merchant ships as a part of
DOSAAF
programs to provide military training for merchant seamen during the
Cold War
. A competition in
air gun
shooting was held on the
Metallurg Baykov
during
Mediterranean
and
Red Sea
voyages from 5-12 July 1981. The ship crossed the equator on 6 July 1984 and received a
crossing certificate
.
Fate
[
edit
]
The
Metallurg Baykov
was decommissioned at
Valencia
in 1985, the third
Leninsky Komsomol-class cargo ship
to be decommissioned and scrapped (after the
Fizik Vavilov
and the
Bratstvo
).

Marin City
is an
unincorporated community
and
census-designated place
(CDP) in
Marin County
,
California
, United States.
[3]
As of the
2020 census
, it had a population of 2,993,
[4]
up from 2,666 in 2010. It is located 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) northwest of downtown
Sausalito
,
[5]
8 miles (13 km) south-southeast of
San Rafael
,
[6]
and about 5 miles (8 km) north of
San Francisco
from the
Golden Gate Bridge
, at an elevation of 23 feet (7.0 m).
[3]
Marin City was developed for housing starting in 1942, to accommodate
wartime
shipyard workers and other migrants to California. Among those were African Americans from the South in the
Great Migration
, which continued until 1970.
After
World War II
, the area became predominantly
African-American
, as
white
residents were able to move freely to private housing elsewhere in Marin County. Since the 1980s, additional development has changed the makeup of the population while providing more local jobs. In 2018, Marin City's socioeconomic and racial makeup (median household income of $40,000, and almost 40 percent Black) contrasts with the mostly wealthy and White population in Marin County overall (greater than $80,000 median income, less than four percent Black).
[7]
[8]
History
[
edit
]
Prior to
World War II
, this area was occupied by a
dairy farm
and a handful of families. Soon after war was declared on December 8, 1941, Marin City was rapidly built during 1942 in order to house 6,000 of the 20,000 workers who migrated from all over the United States, attracted by the defense jobs at
Marinship
, the Sausalito waterfront shipyard. A total of 93
liberty ships
and tankers were built and launched from Marinship in fewer than three years.
[9]
Many of the
African-American
shipyard laborers who had migrated to the Bay Area from the
South
during the
second phase
of the
Great Migration
continued to live in Marin City after the war, either by choice or because many black families were restricted by local
zoning
from living in or buying homes in the towns surrounding Marin City.
[9]
They became the core of the community after many of the other workers moved to other areas at the end of the war.
[9]
During the war, African Americans comprised about 10 percent of Marin City's population. By the 1970s, African Americans comprised more than 75 percent of the population of Marin City, most of whom were descendants of the Marinship workers.
[9]
During the 1980s and 1990s there was considerable residential and commercial development in the community, including several new housing developments, apartment complexes, and condo developments.
[9]
The commercial area was expanded, particularly with the construction of the Gateway Shopping Center in 1996, which displaced a locally renowned
flea market
.
[9]
As of 2010, the community population was 38.9 percent white and 38.1 percent African American; nearly 14 percent were Hispanic of any race. In the early 21st century, Marin City residents and officials have begun to think about incorporating as a city.
[10]

Education
[
edit
]
Marin City is served by the
Sausalito Marin City School District
for primary grades (K-8) and the
Tamalpais Union High School District
for secondary grades. The K-8 district operates Martin Luther King, Jr. Academy (Formerly Bayside-Martin Luther King Jr. Academy), a K-8 school with preschool and middle school in Marin City and elementary school in
Sausalito
.
[19]
There was formerly
Willow Creek Academy
, a public
charter school
in Sausalito which is affiliated with the district. As of 2016
about 150 students in Marin City attended Willow Creek, while Bayside King had a total student enrollment of 143.
[20]
As of the 2018-2019 school year Willow Creek Academy has 407 students enrolled. Being that Willow Creek is a charter school they welcome anyone who lives in California, although most of the students live within the school district, which is Sausalito and Marin City and other communities in Marin County. Several parents outside of the county also found that Willow Creek was a good fit for their children, most of them being from Fairfield and Vallejo.
[21]
In previous eras Grades K-6 were allowed to attended either Bayside Elementary School in Sausalito or Willow Creek Academy (a public charter school), both in Sausalito. Grades 7-8 attended Martin Luther King Jr. Academy in Marin City, or Willow Creek Academy. Residents may attend Willow Creek Academy, a K-8 school in Sausalito. Beginning in the fall of 2013, Bayside was scheduled to close, with Willow Creek taking the former Bayside campus, making MLK a K-8.
[22]
The consolidation of Bayside into MLK will be in effect in the fall of 2013.
[23]
In 2014 Bayside moved to Marin City joining MLK, now being known as
Bayside MLK Academy
. During this time they had no stable principal and not enough teachers for each class.  As of now the principal of the school is David Finnane. The new motto of the school is "Panther Pride". Pride standing for,
Pride, Respect, Integrity, Determination, Excellence
.
[24]
In 2021 Willow Creek consolidated into the Martin Luther King School in Marin City.
[25]
Students in grades 9-12 attend
Tamalpais High School
in
Mill Valley
and Redwood High School.

Homes sold in Marin City are often labeled as being located in
Sausalito
since Marin City shares the 94965
ZIP Code
, the 331 and 332 telephone prefixes, and Sausalito Marin City School District with its close neighbor Sausalito. Most of the housing in Marin City was developed in the 1970s, '80s and '90s after much of the temporary Marinship housing put up in 1942 had been razed.

Data breach of Yahoo! Voices accounts
2012 Yahoo! Voices hack
Date
July 12, 2012
(
2012-07-12
)
Cause
Hack
Suspects
D33ds
Yahoo! Voices
, formerly Associated Content, was hacked in July 2012. The hack is supposed to have leaked approximately half a million
email
addresses and
passwords
associated with Yahoo! Contributor Network.
[1]
The suspected hacker group, D33ds, used a method of
SQL Injection
to penetrate Yahoo! Voice servers. Security experts said that the passwords were not
encrypted
and the website did not use a
HTTPS Protocol
, which was one of the major reasons of the
data breach
.
[2]
The email addresses and passwords are still available to download in a plaintext file on the hacker's website. The hacker group described the hack as a "wake-up call" for Yahoo! security experts.
[3]
Joseph Bonneau, a security researcher and a former product analysis manager at Yahoo, said "Yahoo can fairly be criticized in this case for not integrating the Associated Content accounts more quickly into the general Yahoo login system, for which I can tell you that password protection is much stronger."
[4]
Reaction by communities and users
[
edit
]
D33DS, the suspected hacker group, said that the hack was a "wake-up call". They said that it was not a threat to Yahoo!, Inc. The IT Security firm TrustedSec.net said that the passwords contained a number of email addresses from
Gmail
,
AOL
,
Yahoo
, and more such websites.
[5]
Response from Yahoo
[
edit
]
Immediately after the hack, Yahoo!, in a written statement, apologized for the breach. Yahoo! did not disclose how many passwords were valid after the hack, because they said that every minute, 1-3 passwords are changed on their site.
[6]
Yahoo! said that only 5% of its passwords were stolen during the hack.
[7]
The hackers' website,
d33ds.co
, was not available later on Thursday, after the hack.
[8]
Yahoo! said in a written statement that it takes security very seriously and is working together to fix the vulnerability in its site. Yahoo! said that it was in the process of changing the passwords of the hacked accounts and notifying other companies of the hack.
[4]
[9]
Controversy
[
edit
]
A simple matter had sparked a controversy over Yahoo!. The controversy was sparked because of Yahoo!'s silence about the data breach. After the servers were hacked, Yahoo! did not mail the affected victims, although it was promised earlier. There was no site-wide notifications about the hack, nor did any victim get any type of personal messages detailing how to reset their account passwords from Yahoo.

Hauho
is a
former municipality
of
Finland
. It was situated in the
province
of
Southern Finland
and is today a part of the
region
of
Tavastia Proper
(Kanta-Häme / Egentliga Tavastland).
Hauho was amalgamated with the municipality of
Hämeenlinna
on 1 January 2009. Prior to the amalgamation, Hauho - which was unilingually
Finnish
- had had a population of 3,934 (31 December 2008)
[3]
and covered an area of 443.13 square kilometres (171.09 sq mi) of which 86.42 square kilometres (33.37 sq mi) was water.
[1]
The
population density
was 11.1 inhabitants per square kilometre (29/sq mi).
It has been calculated that Hauho lies at Finland's
"population-centre"
(Weber point), that is to say: the point in Finland closest on average to the place of residence of every inhabitant of the country.
Lakes
Iso-Roine
,
Hauhonselkä
, and

The
bombing of Foggia
took place on several occasions in 1943, by
Allied
aircraft. The bombing caused 20,298 civilian victims during nine air raids.
The aim of the Allied Forces was to prevent the use of the transport network and airfields at
Foggia
. The transport network was an important focal point in the deployment of German and Italian troops used to counter the Allied attacks on Southern Italy and the invasion of Sicily in July (
Operation Husky
). It has been claimed that the raids were too extensive and caused excessively high levels of deaths and casualties amongst the civilian population (about a third of the population were killed.
[

]
The air raids continued after an armistice had been signed between the Allies and Italy due to the concentration of German troops in Foggia.
The city of Foggia was awarded the Italian
gold medal for civil valor
on 22 November 1959 for having suffered 20,298 victims, and of the Italian
gold medal for military valor
on 25 April 2007.
The bombing
[
edit
]
Foggia was attacked on nine occasions. Thousands of homes in residential districts, the airport, the
railway station
, and numerous squares and streets were totally devastated.
A chronicle of the bombing of Foggia was written by
Luca Cicolella
in a book called
"...e la morte venne dal cielo"
("...and death came from the sky"), published in 1973 and 1983, which also contained the
Report
made by the Monsignor
Fortunato Maria Farina
and sent to
Pope Pius XII
.
[22 July 1943] The station clock says 9.43. The sky suddenly darkens. Forty Flying Fortresses and more than fifty fighter planes descend upon Foggia. When the bell of the Town Hall tolls to give the alarm, the massacre has already begun. The first bombs fall on the station, smashing the buildings with extraordinary violence and closing the entrances to the underpasses from which heart-rending cries of pain can be heard. A train has arrived from Bari a few minutes before. Many travellers have been caught by surprise as they entered the underpasses. Others believe that they can shelter from the fury of the bombardment in the same underpasses. Instead they go to a certain death...
For a short period Foggia became a ghost town in which looters sought valuables worn by the casualties and burgled abandoned buildings.
... There are some who decide to exploit the tragedy. In the night the flying fortresses do not return. Instead the thieves arrive. They are "jackals" who pounce upon the dead, rummaging in their pockets and taking money, rings and gold chains. They enter the half-ruined houses, filling boxes with linen, and running off with furniture and jewellery. Every night they return to plunder the city. No one intervenes. People are afraid that they are armed.
Although an
Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces
was declared on September 8, Allied forces continued bombing until September 15, ostensibly to prevent German troop movements, as the town had been occupied by German troops in the aftermath of the Armistice.

Thawte Consulting
(pronounced "thought"
[
citation needed
]
) is a
certificate authority
(CA) for
X.509
certificates. Thawte was founded in 1995 by
Mark Shuttleworth
in South Africa. As of December 30, 2016, its then-parent company,
Symantec Group
, was collectively the third largest public CA on the Internet with 17.2% market share.
[1]
History
[
edit
]
Thawte was originally run from
Mark Shuttleworth
's parents' garage. Shuttleworth originally aimed to produce a secure server not fettered by the restrictions on the
export of cryptography
which had been
imposed by the United States
. The server, Sioux, was a
fork
of the
Apache HTTP server
; it was later integrated with the
Stronghold
web server as Thawte began to concentrate more on their certification activities.
[2]
In 1999,
Verisign
acquired Thawte in a stock purchase from Shuttleworth for
US
$575 million.
[3]
Both Verisign and Thawte had certificates in the first
Netscape
browsers, and were thus "
grandfathered
" into all other
web browsers
. Before Verisign's purchase, they each had about 50% of the market. Verisign's
certificate
rollover was due to take place on 1 January 2000—an unfortunate choice considering the imminent
Y2K
bug. (Thawte had a similar rollover in July 1998.) The purchase of Thawte ensured there would be no business loss over Y2K.
[4]
Proceeds from the sale enabled Shuttleworth to become the second
space tourist
[5]
and to found the
Ubuntu
project through the creation of
Canonical
.
[6]
[7]
In August 2010,
Symantec
acquired Verisign's security business, including Thawte.
[8]
Thawte is now part of
DigiCert
with its acquisition of Symantec's web security assets in 2017.
[9]
Root certificate untrust
[
edit
]
Following Thawte's improper issuance of certificates and a dispute with
Google
, the GeoTrust Root Certificate became untrusted.
[10]
This led to the sale of Symantec's certificate business which included Thawte in August 2017 to
Thoma Bravo LLC
for $1 billion
[11]
with the intention of merging it with
DigiCert
.
[12]
From 1 December 2017, Thawte started to issue all new certificates under the DigiCert Trusted Root TLS Certificate.
[13]
Web of Trust
[
edit
]
Main article:
Web of trust
The Thawte Web of Trust was discontinued on 16 November 2009.
[14]
Thawte used to issue free email certificates and the Thawte Web of Trust was the optional identity verification mechanism for it. To obtain a free Thawte email certificate, a person needed to sign up for a Thawte FreeMail account which allowed a person to create as many certificates as they wanted. Although each certificate was associated with exactly one email address, multiple email addresses could have been associated with a single Thawte FreeMail account. So if a person had more than one email address, they could have created a different certificate for each of them through the same account.
Associating the Thawte FreeMail account with the real identity of the person owning was based on a
Web of trust
model. The person's identity was assured by meeting face-to-face with one or more "Thawte Notaries" who needed to see identification and keep a copy of it (for at least five years). Points were assigned by the notaries. The number of points a notary could have assigned ranges from 10 to 35. In general, the more experienced a notary was the more points they could have assigned (see table below). Notaries who were directly verified by Thawte, through events Thawte attended or held, automatically could have issued 35 points without needing to gain experience.
The number of points determined what that person's account can do. With fewer than 50 points, the certificates issued had "Thawte Freemail Member" in the name field. With 50 or more points, the certificates had the person's name in it. The presence of the person's real name in the certificate can be useful for identifying the certificate (e.g., when stored in a key store) and to help the recipient to recognise and trust the certificate. For the purposes of signing and encrypting both types of certificates could be used in the same way, because both types of certificates had the person's email address in it.
With 100 or more points, a person became a Thawte Notary. When a person becomes a notary, they were initially listed underneath their country. They could then change that location and add text to advertise the services they offer. Changes to the advertising text were approved by Thawte and the notary was placed in a pending state while it waits approval. The approval process could take several weeks, during which the person's advertisement was not published and the system did not let them access it as a notary. Cross notarisation was not allowed: a notary could not notarise a person who had notarised them.

After end of life
[
edit
]
Thawte Notaries have been submitting minimal information to the Gossamer Spider Web of Trust ("GSWoT"; a grass-roots
OpenPGP
PKI
) for safe-keeping in hopes to increase the longevity of their earned trust points. The collaborative effort aims to bind Thawte Notary names and email addresses to their now-existing entry on Thawte's Web of Trust Notary Map. Thawte Notaries from within and without GSWoT are performing the validations. The initiative will bear no fruit if Thawte Notaries fail to find or create a WoT that will recognise their former status as a Thawte Web of Trust Notary. The Thawte WoT Notaries List on GSWoT was maintained until 16 November 2010.
CAcert
, the free certification authority, took over a large part of the participants of the Thawte Web of Trust through a special programme.

All About Jazz
[4]
The
AllMusic
review by Thom Jurek stated "The band on
Morton's Foot
is a truly international ensemble. ... Abou-Khalil's compositions here, as on his other recordings, involve detailed, complex, and labyrinthine melodic structures, though rhythmic invention and harmonic counterpoint add balance and offer tight turns of phrase and dynamic shifts. ... it is the sum of everything here that makes this one of Abou-Khalil's very best outings".
[2]
In
The Guardian
, John Fordham wrote "Lebanese oud player, flautist and composer Rabih Abou-Khalil is doing what he does best: situating his shapely instrumental virtuosity within the unique ensemble that combines cafe-accordion whimsy, fluid contemporary jazz, Italian-wedding clarinet, New Orleans street-music tuba and a mix of punchy swing".
[3]
All About Jazz
said "The international ensemble that performs on
Morton's Foot
brings its array of influences together for a freeform improv-rich jam that feels joyful even its most pensive moments ... This is a top pick of 2004, without a doubt" and John Kelman wrote "Abou-Khalil's recordings are never short of completely engrossing, blending his ethnic heritage with spirited and joyous playing in contexts that never cease to surprise. If an artist came out with but one album as good as Morton's Foot , he/she would be assured a place in jazz history; but the truth is Abou-Khalil manages to succeed at this level with almost every release".
[5]
[6]
Jim Santella observed "Abou-Khalil covers a wide range with his compositional use of threads that cross cultures. He's included blatant comedy, dramatic intensity, and sensual passion in his structures. The ensemble responds with spontaneous interpretations that flow seamlessly. Abou-Khalil's music holds something for everyone".

Field Songs
is the fifth solo album by
Mark Lanegan
, released in 2001 on the
Beggars Banquet
label
.
Recording
[
edit
]
The two largest instrumental contributors are
Mike Johnson
and
Ben Shepherd
, the latter co-writing "Blues for D" with the singer.  The album also features
Duff McKagan
of
Velvet Revolver
and
Guns N' Roses
as well as Lanegan's ex-wife,
Wendy Rae Fowler
.
Chris Goss
sings on "She Done too Much."
The album represents a departure of sorts for the singer.  While retaining the acoustic atmosphere of his previous solo efforts,
Field Songs
incorporates Middle Eastern influences ("No Easy Action") as well as experimental musical landscapes ("Miracle," "Blues for D") which elicited comparisons from critics to
Tom Waits
.

Lanegan's gravelly, gin-soaked vocals on "Don't Forget Me" and "Fix" is balanced out by his delicate delivery featured on "Kimiko's Dream House" and "Pill Hill Serenade."  In his 2017 book
I Am the Wolf: Lyrics and Writings
, Lanegan says of
Field Songs
:
I consider the finished album to be one of my best, and it contains some of my favorite songs: "Don't Forget Me," in which I flat-out took the melody and phrasing from an Israeli folk song and was immediately busted for it by fans when it was released; "One Way Street," which has been a constant in my set lists since the day it came out; and "No Easy Action," which I wrote after reading two stories in the newspaper one morning..."Kimiko's Dream House" was a gift from my favorite singer, friend, and mentor
Jeffrey Lee Pierce
. He gave me the music and half the lyrics and said, "Finish it."
Reception
[
edit
]
AllMusic
's Sam Samuelson writes, "Upon repeated listens, standout tracks such as 'Miracle,' 'Kimiko's Dream House,' and 'Fix' become infectiously memorable as convincing tales about love gained and lost. All in all, every track is solid and worthy of numerous spins."

Operation Nordlicht
(German, 'Northern Light') was a
German
operation during the end of
World War II
. After
Finland
had made peace with the
USSR
, the Germans planned to fall back to defense lines built and equipped in advance across
Finnish Lapland
(
Operation Birke
). During the operation, the
Oberkommando der Wehrmacht
gave an order to move from
Operation Birke
to Operation Nordlicht on 4 October 1944. That meant that instead of evacuating everything and then fortifying on the strong defensive positions, the German
20th Mountain Army
was to retreat according to a set timetable to a new defense line in
Lyngen
,
Norway
.
[1]
The Germans retreated using
scorched-earth
tactics and destroyed almost all buildings and all boats in
Finnmark
, thus denying the enemy any facilities in the area. The same tactics had already been used in Finnish Lapland. The retreat ended on 20 January 1945.
[2]
A detailed account of 'the Nazis' scorched earth campaign in Norway' by Vincent Hunt includes statements by eyewitnesses, photographs taken at the time and a map of locations and prisoner of war camps.

Early insignia
VA-37 was established as an
A-7 Corsair II
squadron on 1 July 1966. After training with
VA-174
in the operation of the A-7 from July-November 1967, VA-37 became operational in 1967, deploying aboard
USS
Kitty Hawk
.
1970s

VA-37
A-7A
landing aboard
USS
Saratoga
off Vietnam, in 1972
In September 1970, VA-37 was embarked on
USS
Saratoga
when
fighting erupted between Palestinian forces and the Jordanian Army
, and was directed to operate in the eastern Mediterranean in response to this crisis. On 29 September 1970, VA-37 participated in an air power demonstration for President
Richard Nixon
during his two-day visit to USS
Saratoga
while she steamed in the Mediterranean. From June to October 1971, VA-37 participated in the test and evaluation of the new CV concept during USS
Saratoga
'
s deployment to the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The CV concept involved combining the capabilities of the attack and antisubmarine carriers (CVA and CVS) into a single ship.
The squadron deployed twice to
Yankee Station
in support of combat operations during the
Vietnam War
. On 1 August 1972, a squadron A-7A was used to establish a
sonobuoy
field in an anchorage area near the island of Hon Nieu, off the coast of North Vietnam - the first time an A-7 had ever been used to drop sonobuoys.
In 1973, the squadron received their first A-7E, a more advanced version of the plane. They made seven cruises with this plane in the 1970s and early 1980s, including responding to regional crises in the
Mediterranean Sea
and
Indian Ocean
.
1980s
[

, with VA-37 embarked as part of
Carrier Air Wing Three
, deployed from
Naval Station Norfolk
, Virginia for a seven-month cruise that saw USS
John F. Kennedy
sail to the Arabian Sea via the Mediterranean Sea and Suez Canal. During this time port visits took place in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, and Malaga, Spain. During their time operating in the Arabian Sea, VA-37 and USS
John F. Kennedy
conducted port visits at Perth, Australia and Mombasa, Kenya, before, in June 1982, taking station off the coast of
Lebanon
after
the Israeli invasion
. After leaving the area another port visit took place in Toulon, France, before returning home on 14 July 1982.
From 1 October 1982 VA-37 became part of Carrier Air Wing Fifteen (CVW-15) and in January 1983 as part of CVW-15 they embarked on board the then newest Navy carrier,
USS
Carl Vinson
.
VA-37 headed to
Roosevelt Roads Naval Station
in Puerto Rico in August 1942 for exercises with the destroyer
USS
Mahan
, which was the test platform for the development of the
CG/SM-2 (ER)
missile program project.
On 1 March VA-37 sailed with CVW-15 and USS
Carl Vinson
on an eight-month would cruise that saw them operate in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, South China Sea, and Pacific Ocean in a multitude of exercises and with port visits in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Casablanca, Morocco, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Perth, Australia, Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong, Sasebo, Japan, Pusan, Republic of Korea, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before returning to NAS Cecil Field in Florida on 29 October 1983.
In June 1984, the squadron's primary mission was changed to
close air support
in preparation for its deployment to
MCAS Iwakuni
as part of the Marine Corps
Unit Deployment Program
. The deployment of the two Navy attack squadrons was designed to test the interoperability of the Marine Corps and Navy.
In December 1984, VA-37 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni and relieved
VA-105
. While deployed to Iwakuni, the squadron was detached to
Yechon
, Korea, to participate in exercise Team Spirit 85. This was the first time a Navy carrier-based squadron had deployed in field conditions since World War II.
In April 1988, VA-37 deployed with
Carrier Air Wing Six (CVW-6)
on board
USS
Forrestal
to the North Arabian Sea via the Suez Canal in support of
Operation Earnest Will
. The squadron spent 108 consecutive days at sea before USS
Forrestal
anchored at its first liberty port, Naples, Italy.

Following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990, several squadron aircraft were deployed with
VA-72
in support of
Operation Desert Shield
.
On 31 October 1990, the squadron flew their last official sortie in the A-7E Corsair II. This ended a 25-year association in which over 115,000 flight hours and 25,000 arrestments were flown. On 28 November 1990, VA-37 was redesignated
Strike Fight Squadron Thirty Seven (VFA-37)
and began flying the
F/A-18 Hornet
. From October 1992 to April 1993, VFA-37 deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and participated in
Operation Provide Comfort
in northern
Iraq
and
Operation Provide Promise
in the airspace near the former
Yugoslavia
.
In 1994 the squadron flew missions over Iraq in support of
Operation Southern Watch
(OSW) and later over
Bosnia
in support of
Operation Deny Flight
. The squadron also participated in major exercises with the Kuwaitis,
Saudis
, and
Israelis
, as well as with many
NATO
allies.
In November 1996, the squadron flew in support of Operation Southern Watch and
Operation Deliberate Guard

A
booster pump
is a machine which increases the
pressure
of a fluid. It may be used with liquids or gases, and the construction details vary depending on the fluid. A gas booster is similar to a
gas compressor
, but generally a simpler mechanism which often has only a single stage of compression, and is used to increase pressure of a gas already above ambient pressure. Two-stage boosters are also made.
[1]
Boosters may be used for increasing gas pressure, transferring high pressure gas, charging
gas cylinders
and scavenging.

On new construction and retrofit projects, water pressure booster pumps are used to provide adequate water pressure to upper floors of high rise buildings. The need for a water pressure booster pump can also arise after the installation of a backflow prevention device (BFP), which is currently mandated in many municipalities
[
where?
]
to protect the public water supplies from contaminants within a building entering the public water supply. The use of BFPs began after The
Clean Water Act
was passed. These devices can cause a loss of 12 PSI, and can cause
flushometers
on upper floors not to work properly.
After pipes have been in service for an extended period, scale can build up on the inside surfaces which will cause a pressure drop when the water flows.
Water pressure booster construction and function
[
edit
]
Booster pumps for household water pressure are usually simple electrically driven centrifugal pumps with a non-return valve. They may be constant speed pumps which switch on when pressure drops below the low pressure set-point and switch off when pressure reaches the high set-point, or variable speed pumps which are controlled to maintain a constant output pressure.
Constant speed pumps are switched on by a normally closed low-pressure switch and will content to run until the pressure rises to open the high pressure switch. They will cycle whenever enough water is used to cause a pressure drop below the low set point. An accumulator in the upstream pipeline will reduce cycling.
Variable speed pumps use pressure feedback to electronically control motor speed to maintain a reasonably constant discharge pressure. Most applications run off AC mains current and use an
inverter
to control motor speed.
Installations that provide water to highrise buildings may need boosters at several levels to provide acceptably consistent pressure on all floors. In such a case independent boosters may be installed at various levels, each boosting the pressure provided by the next lower level. It is also possible to boost once to the maximum pressure required, and then to use a pressure reducer at each level. This method would be used if there is a holding tank on the roof with gravity feed to the supply system.
Fire sprinkler booster pumps
[
edit
]
Main article:
Fire pump
Multi-story buildings equipped with
fire sprinkler systems
may require a large booster pump to deliver sufficient water pressure and volume to upper floors in the event of a fire. Such pumps are often powered by a
diesel engine
dedicated to this purpose. The engine needs a fuel tank and an automatic controller that will start the booster pump when it is needed. A small auxiliary electrically-powered booster pump (called a "jockey pump") is often included in the system to maintain the sprinkler pipes at sufficient pressure, without requiring startup of the large diesel engine.
Any emergency system must be periodically tested and maintained to ensure its reliability. A diesel engine must be started and operated for testing, and a battery bank for the starting motor must be maintained or replaced periodically. In recent years, a larger electrical pump with substantial
battery backup
may be substituted for the diesel engine, reducing but not eliminating the need for maintenance.
Gas pressure
[
edit
]
Principle of a gas booster pump used to increase pressure of a compressed air supply
Gas pressure boosting may be used to fill storage cylinders to a higher pressure than the available gas supply, or to provide production gas at pressure higher than line pressure. Examples include:
Breathing gas
blending
for underwater diving where the gas is to be supplied from high-pressure cylinders, as in
scuba
,
scuba replacement
and
surface-supplied mixed gas diving
, where the component gases are blended by partial pressure addition to the storage cylinders, and the mixture storage pressure may be higher than the available pressure of the components.
[2]
Helium reclaim systems
, where the
heliox
breathing gas exhaled by a
saturation diver
is piped back to the surface, oxygen is added to make up the required composition, and the gas is boosted to the appropriate supply pressure, filtered,
scrubbed of carbon dioxide
, and returned to the gas distribution panel to be supplied to the diver again.
[3]
Workshop compressed air is usually provided at a pressure suited to the majority of the applications, but some may need a higher pressure. A small booster can be effective to provide this air.
Gas booster construction and function
[
edit
]
Schematic diagram of pneumatic powered gas booster types. Top to bottom: Single stage, single action; single stage double action; two stage double action.
Gas booster pumps are usually
piston
or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, single-stage booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed to withstand the operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into the space between the cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalized, taking valve opening pressures into account.
[1]
Once the flow has stopped, the booster is started, and as the piston withdraws along the cylinder, increasing the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing the volume of the space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet valve and port.
There will always be some compressed gas remaining in the cylinder and cylinder head spaces at the top of the stroke. The gas in this "dead space" will expand during the next induction stroke, and only after it has dropped below the supply gas pressure, more supply gas will flow into the cylinder. The ratio of the volume of the cylinder space with the piston fully withdrawn, to the dead space, is the "compression ratio" of the booster, also termed "boost ratio" in this context. Efficiency of the booster is related to the compression ratio, and gas will only be transferred while the pressure ratio between supply and discharge gas is less than the boost ratio, and delivery rate will drop as the inlet to delivery pressure ratio increases.
Delivery rate starts at very close to swept volume when there is no pressure difference, and drops steadily until there is no effective transfer when the pressure ratio reaches the maximum boost ratio.
[1]
Compression of gas will cause a rise in temperature. The heat is mostly carried out by the compressed gas, but the booster components will also be heated by contact with the hot gas. Some boosters are cooled by water jackets or external fins to increase convectional cooling by the ambient air, but smaller models may have no special cooling facilities at all. Cooling arrangements will improve efficiency, but will cost more to manufacture.
Boosters to be used with oxygen must be made from oxygen-compatible materials, and use oxygen-compatible lubricants to avoid fire.
[1]
Configurations
[
edit
]
Single stage, single acting: There is one booster cylinder, which pressurizes the gas in one direction of piston movement, and refills the cylinder on the return stroke.
Single stage, double acting: There are two booster cylinders, which operate alternately, with each one pressurizing gas while the other is refilling. The cylinders each pressurize gas-fed directly from the supply, and the delivered gas from each is combined at the outlets. The cylinders work in parallel and have the same bore.
Two stage, double acting: There are two cylinders, which operate alternately, each pressurising gas while the other is refilling, but the second stage has a smaller bore and is filled by the gas pressurised by the first stage, and it pressurises the gas further. The stages operate in series, and the gas passes though both of them in turn.
Power sources
[

Small air powered portable high pressure breathing gas booster pump
Gas boosters may be driven by an
electric motor
,
hydraulics
, low or high pressure air, or manually by a lever system.
Compressed air
[
edit
]
Those powered by
compressed air
are usually linear actuated systems, where a pneumatic cylinder directly drives the compression piston, often in a common housing, separated by one or more seals. A high pressure pneumatic drive arrangement may use the same pressure as the output pressure to drive the piston, and a low pressure drive will use a larger diameter piston to multiply the applied force.
[1]
Low pressure air
[
edit
]
A common arrangement for low pressure air powered boosters is for the booster pistons to be direct coupled with the drive piston, on the same centreline. The low pressure cylinder has a considerably larger section area than the high pressure cylinders, in proportion to the pressure ratio between the drive and boosted gas. A single action booster of this type has a boost cylinder on one end of the power cylinder, and a double action booster has a boost cylinder on each end of the power cylinder, and the piston rod has a drive piston in the middle and a booster piston on each end.
[1]
Oxygen boosters require some design features which may not be necessary in boosters for less reactive gases. It is necessary to ensure that drive air, which may not be sufficiently clean for safe contact with high pressure oxygen, cannot leak past the seals into the booster cylinder, or high pressure oxygen can not leak ito the drive cylinder. This can be done by providing a space between the low pressure cylinder and high pressure cylinder that is vented to atmosphere, and the piston rod is sealed on each side where it passes through this space. Any gas leaks from either cylinder past the rod seals escapes harmlessly into the ambient air.
[1]
A special case for gas powered boosters is where the booster uses the same gas supply to power the booster and as the gas to be boosted. This arrangement is wasteful of gas and is most suitable for use to provide small quantities of higher pressure air where large quantities of lower pressure air are already available. This system is sometimes known as a "bootstrap" booster.

Electrically powered boosters may use a single or three-phase AC motor drive. The high speed rotational output of the motor must be converted to lower speed reciprocating motion of the pistons. One way this has been done (Dräger and Russian KN-3  and KN-4 military boosters) is to connect the motor to a worm drive gearbox with an eccentric output shaft driving a connecting rod which drives the double-ended piston via a central trunnion. This system is well suited to a double acting booster, either with single-stage boost by parallel connected cylinders with the same bore, or two-stage cylinders of different bores connected in series. Some of these boosters allow for the connecting rod to be disconnected and a pair of long levers to be fitted for manual operation in emergencies or where electrical power is not available.
[1]
Manual
[
edit
]
Schematic diagram of double action single stage gas booster with manual lever operation
Manual boosters have been made with the configuration described above, either with a single vertical lever or with a seesaw styled double ended horizontal lever, and also with two parallel vertically mounted cylinders, much like the lever-operated
diver's air pumps
used for the early
standard diving dress
but with much smaller bore to allow two operators to generate high pressures.
[1]
Manufacturers
[
edit
]
High pressure gas boosters are manufactured by Haskel, MPS Technology, Dräger, Gas Compression Systems and others. Rugged and unsophisticated models (KN-3 and KN-4) were manufactured for the
Soviet Armed Forces
and surplus examples are now used by
technical divers
as they are relatively inexpensive and are supplied with a comprehensive spares and tool kit.

The First Final Farewell Tour
(2004-05)
Not Dead Yet Tour
(2017-19)
The
Not Dead Yet Tour
(also known as
Not Dead Yet Live!
and
Still Not Dead Yet Live!
) was a
concert tour
by English recording artist
Phil Collins
, named after his autobiography released on 25 October 2016.
[1]
Background
[
edit
]
Collins performing to 65,000 at
Hyde Park
, London on 30 June 2017 as part of the Not Dead Yet Tour.
Collins announced the tour on 17 October 2016 at a press conference held at the
Royal Albert Hall
in London. The tour included five concerts at the venue, and five each at the
Lanxess Arena
in Cologne and at the
AccorHotels Arena
in Paris.
[2]
On 8 November 2016, news of Collins's headline spot at a concert at London's
Hyde Park
was announced. On 16 December 2016, it was announced that Collins would play at Dublin's
Aviva Stadium
on Sunday 25 June 2017.
[3]
On 27 February 2017, it was announced that Collins would play at Liverpool's
Echo Arena
on Friday 2 June 2017. On 8 June 2017, it was announced that Collins's cancelled concerts on 8 and 9 June would be rearranged for 26 and 27 November. The two concerts had been cancelled after Collins had tripped over a step in the bedroom of his London hotel (and had been taken to hospital) following a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 7 June.
[4]
Due to ongoing nerve problems with his hands, this was the first tour where Collins did not play drums at any point in the show. Instead, he employed his son Nicholas to handle all drum parts. However, Collins did use a
cajón
during later parts of the tour.

Ryū Chishū
Chishū Ryū
(
笠 智衆
,
Ryū Chishū
, May 13, 1904 - March 16, 1993)
was a Japanese actor who, in a career lasting 65 years, appeared in over 160 films and about 70 television productions.
[1]
Early life
[
edit
]
Ryū was born in Tamamizu Village,
Tamana
County, a rural area of
Kumamoto Prefecture
in
Kyushu
, the most southerly and westerly of the four main islands of
Japan
. His father was chief priest of Raishōji (来照寺), a temple of the
Honganji
School of
Pure Land Buddhism
. Ryū attended the village elementary school and a prefectural middle school before entering the Department of Indian Philosophy and Ethics at
Tōyō University
to study Buddhism. His parents hoped he would succeed his father as priest of Raishōji, but Ryū had no wish to do so and in 1925 dropped out of university and enrolled in the acting academy of the
Shōchiku
motion picture company's
Kamata
Studios. Shortly afterwards, his father died and Ryū returned home to take on the role of priest. Within half a year or so, however, he passed the office to his older brother and returned to Kamata.
Career
[
edit
]
For about ten years, he was confined to walk-on parts and minor roles, often uncredited. During this time he appeared in fourteen films directed by
Yasujirō Ozu
, beginning with the college comedy
Dreams of Youth
(1928). His first big part was in Ozu's
College is a Nice Place
(1936) and he made his mark as an actor in Ozu's
The Only Son
(also 1936), playing a failed middle-aged school-teacher in spite of the fact that he was only 32. This was his break-through role, and he now began to get major parts in other directors' films. He first played the lead in
Torajirō Saitō
's
Aogeba tōtoshi
(仰げば尊し 1937). His first leading role in an Ozu film was in the
There Was a Father
(父ありき 1942). This was another "elderly" part: he played the father of Shūji Sano, who was only seven years his junior. He was by now undoubtedly Ozu's favourite actor: he eventually appeared in 52 of Ozu's 54 films. He had a role (not always the lead) in every one of Ozu's post-war movies, from
Record of a Tenement Gentleman
(1947) to
An Autumn Afternoon
(1962). He played his most famous "elderly" role in
Tokyo Story
(1953).
Ryū appeared in well over 100 films by other directors. He was in
Keisuke Kinoshita
's
Twenty-four Eyes
(1954) and played wartime Prime Minister
Kantarō Suzuki
in
Kihachi Okamoto
's
Japan's Longest Day
(1967). From 1969 until his death in 1993, he played a curmudgeonly but benevolent Buddhist priest in more than forty of the immensely popular
It's Tough Being a Man
(
Otoko wa tsurai yo
) series starring
Kiyoshi Atsumi
as the lovable pedlar/conman Tora-san. Ryū parodied this role in
Jūzō Itami
's comedy
The Funeral
(1984). Ryū's last film was
It's Tough Being a Man: Torajirō's Youth
(男はつらいよ　寅次郎の青春:
Otoko wa tsurai yo: Torajirō no seishun
1992).
Between 1965 and 1989 he appeared in about 90 TV productions.
Accent
[
edit
]
Ryū retained the rural Kumamoto accent of his childhood throughout his life. It may have held him back early in his career, but became part of his screen persona, denoting reliability and simple honesty. When the columnist Natsuhiko Yamamoto published a deliberately provocative piece called "I Can't Stand Chishū Ryū", in which he derided Ryū's accent, there was a furious reaction, and his magazine
Shūkan Shinchō
(週刊新潮) was inundated with letters of protest.

[1]
The church has a round churchyard, an indication that this site has likely been used since prehistoric times.
[2]
A tombstone dating back to the fifth century was found in the churchyard.
[3]
It is believed that Saint Cynin founded the church as one of a series of missionary stations in the fifth century.
[4]
An
Ogham
stone was found in the churchyard prior to 1900. The stone's inscription is in Latin and Celtic, with the word "ingenia" being substituted for the Latin word "filia".  This type of Ogham stone inscription was common in Ireland, but was the only example of it outside of Ireland when it was discovered at the church.
[5]
[3]
The church is a small building set in a hollow. It was said to be ruinous in 1710 and has a sprocketed, eighteenth-century roof. There is good stained glass windows, and a large carved oak altar and church fittings dating from 1882. Margaret Marloes, to whom it is dedicated, was the niece of Guy de Brian, Lord of Laugharne; a fourteenth-century effigy of her was brought inside the church from the churchyard in 1902 as it was getting badly eroded.
[6]
In 1900 this was a rural parish with a population of 240 persons. The church was in need of immediate repairs and did not have enough money to perform them.  The
Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings
examined the building to estimate the cost of the needed repairs. An appeal for restoration funds was made through the journal
Archaeologica Cambrensis
with the consent of the local bishop.
[7]
It was determined that the present structure dates back to at least the thirteenth century.  The lack of ornamentation of the church made the dating process more difficult. During the examination, a small square opening on the north wall of the nave and a partially underground arch in the south wall were discovered and suggest there may have been an earlier church structure beneath the present one.
[8]
The needed repairs were completed in 1901.
[3]
[4]
The church was designated a
Grade I
-listed building on 30 November 1966, as an example of "an excellent small medieval church with vaulted nave and porch; a notable example of an
Arts and Crafts
restoration associated with
Philip Webb
and with exceptional interior fittings and stained glass".
[9]
The cross in the churchyard became a Grade II listed building 1 December 2001.

European Data Relay System
Mission type
Data transmission
Operator
German Aerospace Center
Website
The
European Data Relay System
(
EDRS
) system is a European
constellation
of
GEO
satellites that relay information and data
between satellites
, spacecraft,
UAVs
, and ground stations. The first components (a payload and dedicated GEO satellite) were launched in 2016 and 2019.
Purpose and context
[
edit
]
The designers intend the system to provide almost full-time communication, even with satellites in
low Earth orbit
that often have reduced visibility from ground stations. It makes on-demand data available to, for example, rescue workers who want near-real-time satellite data of a crisis region.
There are a number of key services that will benefit from this system's infrastructure:
Earth Observation applications in support of time-critical and/or data-intensive services; e.g., change detection, environmental monitoring.
Government and security services that need images from key European space systems such as Global Monitoring for Environment and Security.
Emergency response and crisis intervention applications that need information and data over areas affected by natural or man-made disasters.
Security forces that transmit data to Earth observation satellites, aircraft and unmanned aerial observation vehicles, to reconfigure such systems in real time.
Weather satellite services that require the fast delivery of large quantities of data around the world.
The system has been developed as part of the
ARTES
7 programme and is intended to be an independent, European satellite system that reduces time delays in the transmission of large quantities of data. The programme is similar to the American
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System
that was set up to support the Space Shuttle—but EDRS is using a new generation
Laser Communication Terminal
(LCT) which carries data at a much larger
bit rate
: the laser terminal transmits 1.8 Gbit/s across 45,000 km (the distance of a LEO-GEO link),
[1]
while the TDRSS provides ground reception rates of 600 Mbit/s in the
S-band
and 800 Mbit/s in the
Ku-
and
Ka-bands
.
[2]
Such a terminal was successfully tested in 2007/8 during in-orbit verification between the German radar satellite
TerraSAR-X
and the American
NFIRE
satellite, both in LEO, when it achieved 5.5 gigabits per second.
[3]
A similar LCT was installed on the commercial telecommunication satellite
Alphasat
.
[4]
Network
[
edit
]
EDRS infrastructure consists of two geostationary optical payloads and a Ka band payload, a ground system consisting of a satellite control centre, a mission and operations centre, a feeder link ground station (FLGS), and four data ground stations.
Space Segment
[
edit
]
The first EDRS payload,
EDRS-A
, comprising a laser communication terminal and a
K
a
band
inter-satellite link, was placed on-board
Eutelsat
commercial telecommunication satellite, called Eutelsat 9B (COSPAR 2016-005A). The satellite was launched in January 2016 by a
Proton-M
rocket and will be positioned at 9°E.
[5]
[6]
A second EDRS payload was launched aboard a dedicated spacecraft. The
EDRS-C
(COSPAR 2019-049A), which is also carrying a laser communication terminal, was launched on 6 August 2019
[7]
[8]
and will be positioned at 31°E.
[1]
[9]
The satellite also carries a payload meant for commercial communication satellite use, the
HYLAS 3
payload. Thus the satellite is sometimes referred to as
EDRS-C/HYLAS 3
or something similar.
The EDRS A and C form the initial core
space infrastructure
that provides direct coverage for LEO satellites over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Poles. The initial plan was to develop two further spacecraft to complement the system from 2020 onwards, affording a complete coverage of the Earth and providing long-term system redundancy beyond 2030.
Ground Segment
[
edit
]
The
ground segment
of EDRS includes three
ground receiving stations
located at Weilheim, Germany, Redu, Belgium and Harwell, UK. The prime
Mission Operations Centre
is in Ottobrunn, Germany, while a backup centre is installed in Redu, Belgium.
[10]
The EDRS-A payload as well as the EDRS-C satellite are operated by the German Space Operations Center (GSOC) of the
German Aerospace Center
in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany.

Operations
[
edit
]
The first users for EDRS were the
Sentinel-1 and -2 satellites
of the
Copernicus Programme
(formerly the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security or GMES). The Sentinel satellites provide data for the operational provision of geo-information products and services throughout Europe and the globe. EDRS provides the data relay services for the Sentinel satellites since 2016, facilitating a rapid downlink of large volumes of data (including imagery, voice, and video).
[11]
Implementation
[
edit
]
EDRS is being implemented as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between the
European Space Agency
(ESA) and
Airbus Defence & Space
(ADS, former Astrium).
[12]
ESA funds the infrastructure development and is the anchor customer through the Sentinel satellite missions.  ADS will carry the overall responsibility for the implementation of the space segment including launch, as well as the ground segment. ADS will then
[
when?
]
take over ownership of EDRS and will provide the data transmission services to ESA and customers worldwide.
[
needs update
]
As of May 2023
, EDRS has over one million minutes of communications
[11]
with more than 75,000 successful inter-satellite links.

Awards
Empire Gallantry Medal
Guy Rawstron Branch
,
EGM
(27 October 1913 - 11 August 1940) was a
Royal Air Force
fighter pilot and one of "
The Few
". He was killed in action on 11 August 1940. Since his death occurred before the introduction of the
George Cross
his next-of-kin were not given the opportunity of exchanging the insignia of the
Empire Gallantry Medal
for the new award.
Early life
[
edit
]
Branch was born on 27 October 1913 in
London
, the son of Charles Churchill Branch and Mary Madelaine Bernadette Branch (née Rawstron). He was educated at
Eton College
and
Balliol College, Oxford
.
[1]
On 7 May 1937 he was commissioned as a
pilot officer
in the
Royal Auxiliary Air Force
. On 25 March 1939 in
Lewes
he married Lady Prudence Mary Pelham, daughter of the 6th
Earl of Chichester
.
Accident and award
[
edit
]
On 8 January 1938 Branch was a student pilot was flying as a passenger in a
Hawker Demon
with Pilot Officer Crawley when it crashed and burst into flames at
RAF Upavon
.
[2]
Branch escaped but then returned to the aircraft to free the trapped pilot and pull him clear. For his actions he was awarded the
Empire Gallantry Medal
on 25 March 1938, the citation reading:
[2]
[3]
On 9th January, 1938 an aircraft in which Pilot Officer Branch was a passenger crashed at Upavon, Wiltshire, and immediately burst into flames. Having extricated himself from the burning aircraft this officer found that the pilot was trapped in the cockpit by his legs. Despite the danger of the petrol tank exploding, Pilot Officer Branch returned to the blazing wreckage and, whilst actually standing on burning debris, succeeded in extracting the pilot. There is little doubt that this prompt and gallant act saved the pilot's life. The aircraft was completely destroyed by fire.
[4]
Battle of Britain
[
edit
]
During the
Battle of Britain
Branch, by then a
flying officer
, was a
Hawker Hurricane
pilot with
No. 145 Squadron RAF
. On 8 August 1940 he was credited with destroying two
Junkers Ju 87s
. A few days later on 11 August 1940 while flying Hurricane
serial number
P9251
on a mission to intercept German bombers, a large air battle took place off
Cherbourg
in which Branch was shot down and killed.
[5]
[3]
Branch was buried in the churchyard at
Quiberville
, France.
[6]
His name recorded on the
Battle of Britain Monument in London
,
[7]
and at the
Battle of Britain Memorial, Capel-le-Ferne
.

Au Yeong went on to represent the Combined Schools Team (1976-1978), Singapore Youth Team (1977-78) and the National Intermediate Team (1978).The pinnacle of this youth development phase was when Au Yeong coached, played and captained the Raffles Institution's Post Secondary Team to win the Post Secondary National Schools Championship Finals at the National Stadium in 1978. He scored a hattrick and Raffles Institution went on to win 5-1 over Geylang Serai Vocational Institute. A memorable match firmly etched in his young memory.

MV
Galapagos Legend
is a German-built cruise ship operated by GO Galapagos-Ecuador for cruises in the
Galapagos Islands
. Earlier in its career as the MV
Helgoland
it served as a
hospital ship
during the
Vietnam War
from 1966 to 1971.
History
[
edit
]
The ship was built in 1963 for the
HADAG
shipping company at the
Howaldtswerke Hamburg AG
shipyard as a sea-going ship and operated until 1965 on the
Cuxhaven
-
Helgoland
line. In this function, it replaced the
Bunte Kuh
(1957) and was replaced in 1966 by
Alte Liebe
. From 1963 to 1965, it was chartered several times outside of the summer season to
Stena Line
for service between
Gothenburg
and
Frederikshavn
and between
Stockholm
and
Mariehamn
.
[1]
Vietnam War
[
edit
]
Helgoland
hospital ship in
Da Nang
, January 1970
From 1966, HADAG chartered
Helgoland
to the
German Red Cross
, which, after extensive renovations, commissioned the ship on behalf of the
West German
government as a floating hospital, officially known as the Helgoland hospital ship, in
South Vietnam
.
[2]
Helgoland
had 150 beds for inpatient care, three operating theaters and four specialist departments (surgery, internal medicine, gynecology and radiology). The medical staff included 8 doctors, 4 medical technicians, 4 administrators and 18 nurses. The 30-strong crew consisted of captain, nautical officers, ship engineers, electricians, radio operators, carpenters, sailors and cooks.
In order to ensure special protection as a civilian hospital in an armed conflict, an agreement was concluded between the West German and South Vietnamese governments on 18 May 1966 governing the operation of the hospital ship. The German Red Cross "dispatched a Red Cross hospital ship with civilian personnel in agreement with the government of the Republic of Vietnam " (Article 1). The ship received a certificate from the South Vietnamese government, which classed it as a civil hospital within the meaning of Articles 18 to 20 of the IV
Geneva Conventions of 1949
(Article 4, Paragraph 2); the Red Cross armbands and ID cards to be worn by the ship's personnel were stamped by the Republic of Vietnam (Art. 12, Paragraph 2). The ship was marked with the Red Cross protection symbol and the staff wore the German Red Cross's official clothing during the service (Article 4, Paragraph 1); the ship was exempt from any searches or seizures (Article 4, Paragraph 3). Due to the fact that it was classified as a civilian hospital and not as a hospital ship (in accordance with Article 25 of the II Geneva Conventions), no notifications between the parties to the conflict were required. Nevertheless, the
International Committee of the Red Cross
formally informed the parties involved in the conflict about the ship's duties.
[3]
On 10 August 1966,
Helgoland
set sail for
Saigon
arriving on 3 October 1966. More than 21,000 out-patient treatments were given to approximately 6,700 patients from September 1966 until 30 June 1967. Over 850 major surgical cases were also treated.
[4]
On 12 September 1967
Helgoland
moved to
Da Nang
. 54 doctors and 160 nurses worked on Helgoland during the course of the mission. A total of 11,000 inpatients and 200,000 outpatient treatments were performed, the treatments were free for patients who were all civilians. The mission was funded by the West German government with running costs of about $2.5 million a year.
Helgoland
remained at Da Nang until 31 December 1971 when it was replaced by a new 170 bed hospital ashore, operated by the
Maltese Aid Service
and financed by the West German government. The medical equipment from
Helgoland
was passed to three South Vietnamese hospitals, a local leper colony and the Maltese Hospital.
[2]
[5]
In order to take up supplies from a German supply ship,
Helgoland
had to go into international waters as the supply ship was not allowed to dock in Da Nang for insurance reasons.
Whenever it received warning of a rocket attack on Da Nang the ship would move into Da Nang harbor earning it the nickname
Chicken of the sea
.
[6]
Baltic Sea
[
edit
]
As
Baltic Star
, 1987
HADAG sold the ship to Stena Reederei GmbH in
Kiel
and in 1972 commissioned a new sea-going ship under the name
Helgoland
. The former
Helgoland
was renamed
Stena Finlandica
and ran regular services between Stockholm and Mariehamn, as well as between Kiel and
Korsør
. In 1975 the ship was chartered to
Förde Reederei Seetouristik
GmbH Lübeck and renamed
Baltic Star
. Under this name it served between
Travemünde
and
Rødbyhavn
in
Denmark
. In 1976 it was sold to the KG Seetouristik in
Flensburg
and in 1977
Lübeck
became its home port. From 1987 it was also used between Travemünde and
Warnemünde
. In 1993 it was purchased by Förde Reederei Seetouristik GmbH and made
"Butter Cruises"
on the
Baltic Sea
until 1999 with a capacity of 1,500 passengers.
[1]
Galapagos
[
edit
]
In 2000 the ship was sold to Latin Cruises in
George Town, Cayman Islands
and conversion to a cruise ship followed. Renamed the
Galapagos Legend
, the ship cruised around the Galapagos Islands carrying up to 100 passengers. In 2002, the
Galapagos Legend
was placed under the Georgian flag. In 2006 it was sold to the Galatours shipping company in
Guayaquil
,
Ecuador
.

7
+
1
⁄
2
miles (12 km) south-east of
Charing Cross
and north west of
Eltham
.
The district takes its name from the Kyd Brook, a watercourse which runs from
Orpington
to
Lewisham
, by which point it is part of the
River Quaggy
. It is a tributary to the
River Ravensbourne
.
Housing
[
edit
]
A map showing the Kidbrooke ward of Greenwich Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916
The area contains a large amount of 1920s and 1930s domestic housing, developed partly as the Kidbrooke Park Estate, between
Shooters Hill
and Rochester Way.
A large RAF stores base,
RAF Kidbrooke
, formerly occupied much of the land around
Kidbrooke railway station
, north and south of the railway line.
[2]
In 1965 the Government released most of the land to the Greater London Council for housing. The
Ferrier Estate
, built from 1968, was conceived to be a flagship scheme but became one of the largest and most deprived council housing developments in London.
The housing estate was demolished in 2012 and has been redeveloped as Kidbrooke Village, a development of 5,300 homes masterplanned by
Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands
with Design and Build MEP contractor Cilantro Engineering.
Features
[
edit
]
Houses and gardens in Kidbrooke, January 1980
Immediately south of the former Ferrier Estate is
Sutcliffe Park
which includes a lake, acting as a flood defence, and created by partly releasing the Kyd Brook from concrete conduits underground in which it had run until 2006.
Rochester Way, a road which was built along much of the course of the old country lane Kidbrooke Lane, was intended as a bypass for Shooters Hill to the north. Rochester Way has itself now been bypassed by a dual carriageway - part of the
A2 road
- built in the 1980s over most of Kidbrooke Green. A small remaining piece of this open land, alongside the road, is now Kidbrooke Green Park, and adjacent to that, a small
nature reserve
managed by Greenwich Council. The nature reserve is visible, but not open to the public.
Little sign of the former RAF base remains.  A handful of buildings survive, south of the houses of Nelson Mandela Road, to the north of the railway line, that escaped demolition when the Rochester Way Relief Road dual carriageway was constructed. These are currently used for additional collection storage by the
National Maritime Museum
,
[3]
with some now removed to make way for a new purpose-built conservation facility, the Prince Philip Maritime Collections Centre, which opened in 2019.
[4]
[5]
To the west of this
Thomas Tallis School
is built on another part of the former base, the former site of a prisoner-of-war camp,
barrage balloon
centre, and then a military language-teaching facility.
[6]
[7]
(There are several other military facilities in the general vicinity, which is also close to a surviving base in
Woolwich
, long home to the
Royal Artillery
and now to other parts of the
British Army
.)

Norra skenet
Norra skenet
(Northern Light) is a sculpture by the artist
Ernst Nordin
at the
Umeå University
campus in
Umeå
in
Sweden
.
History
[
edit
]
As part of the planning of the Umeå University campus, a competition for a sculpture was held 1967 and won by Ernst Nordin.
Norra skenet
was raised 1969 at the campus and moved to the actual location close to the University Dam in 1995, due to the construction of the Teachers' Training Hall.
The sculpture is made of polished
stainless steel
. Rectangular steel pipes have been welded together in a diagonal composition, resembling
Aurora Borealis
(Northern Lights). The structure is lit by built-in spotlights.
Umeå University makes use of the sculpture as a symbol in its marketing.

Tiresias appears to
Odysseus
during the
nekyia
of
Odyssey
xi, in this
watercolor
with tempera by the Anglo-Swiss painter
Johann Heinrich Füssli
, c. 1780-85
Published around 30 BCE, the second book of
Satires
is a series of poems composed in
dactylic hexameter
by the Roman poet
Horace
.
Satires 2.5
[1]
stands out in the work for its unique analysis of
legacy hunting
.
Plot summary
[
edit
]
Horace's
Satire Book II, Satire V
is poem about a discussion between
Ulysses
and
Tiresias
that is presented as a continuation of their interaction in the
underworld
in Book 11 of Homer's
Odyssey
. Ulysses is concerned that he will have no wealth once he returns to Ithaca because the suitors will have squandered the contents of his storehouses. Stating bluntly that breeding and character are meaningless without wealth, he asks Tiresias for any suggestions on how to rebuild his prosperity.  Tiresias suggests that Ulysses try his hand at legacy hunting, and gives examples of characters through history that have ingratiated themselves with the affluent in order to be named as benefactors in their will.  Despite Ulysses’ skepticism, Tiresias asserts the plan's merit and provides examples of how to curry favor.
Outline of the Poem
[2]
A. 1-22 Introduction
B. 23-44 Ensnarement of Victim. Flattery
C. 45-69 Precautions. Failure
D. 70-98 Maintenance of Hold over Victim. Flattery
E. 99-110 Conclusions. Success
Analysis
[
edit
]
The structure of the poem places the majority of focus on section C, especially the story of Nasica and Coranus.
[3]
The poem draws from the imagery of hunting, referring to the legacy-seeker as adept with snares and to his prey as an unwary tunny fish.  Most importantly, in the poem “nothing suggests that the typical
senex
has a mind or will of his own.”.
[4]
The victim is utterly objectified and reduced to a feeble creature that the
captator
can exploit.
On a linguistic level, the poem features very colloquial and expressive language.  “‘breeding and character without assets are
vilior alga
--more worthless than seaweed.’   Tell me, says Ulysses, how I can rake together ‘piles of cash’--
aeris acervos
.”.
[5]
The analogies in the text are similarly graphic, as in the story of the over-insistent heir in Thebes who was required by the will of his benefactor to carry her oil-soaked slippery carcass on his shoulders during the funeral procession.
Satire 2.5
is often thought of as the least “Horatian” of the Satires and is often compared to works by
Juvenal
, a poet of the 1st century AD. Juvenal’s poems focus on the perversions of man and hint at Man’s loss of “his highest potentialities”.
[6]
[7]
Many scholars acknowledge this cynicism in
Satire 2.5
and see a connection between the two authors. As Shackleton Bailey writes,
“Uniquely for Horace, it concerns a particular social malpractice (touting for legacies), and its mordant humour has reminded many readers of Juvenal.”
[8]
Characterizations
[
edit
]
Ulysses
[
edit
]
Horace diverges from classical portrayals of Ulysses in this satire.  Ulysses is a heroic Greek protagonist, but in this poem he eschews the importance of noble bearing in favor of temporal riches.  Michael Roberts writes that “the theme of perversion of human values runs throughout the satire,”
[9]
and this is especially relevant to the destitute Ulysses.  Horace’s choice of an established epic hero to request Tiresias’ scheming advice displays a distortion of Greek heroic values.  The poem also distorts the meaning of
xenia
, reducing the powerful bonds of host-guest friendship down to a calculated exchange of flattery for services.  Although Ulysses is mostly silent after line 23, it is implied that he has been swayed by the pragmatism of Tiresias’ words.
Tiresias
[
edit
]
Horace’s characterization of Tiresias is strikingly different from other authors. Instead of portraying him as a great prophet, Horace characterizes him as a shady figure, quick to reveal the secret to making money. With this, the characterization of Tiresias creates a moral tension between the paragon prophet so highly respected in ancient literature and the shady truth-teller that reveals the inner workings of legacy hunting. It is from this tension that the satirical nature of the work is derived.
[10]
Penelope
[
edit
]
Horace also takes a noticeably different tack than other Roman and Greek poets with regard to his characterization of
Penelope
.  Horace introduces her first as the virtuous wife she is typically characterized as in lines 77-78. Ulysses claims that his chaste wife would never betray their vows of monogamy, but Tiresias counters that she is chaste only because the suitors are more motivated by consuming Ulysses’ bountiful stores than by sex.
”But if you make her a partner/ and let her taste some cash at an old fellow’s expense,/ there’ll be no holding her.  She’ll be like a dog with a juicy bone.”
Penelope, classically a bastion of chastity, is hereby portrayed as corruptible like any other woman.

The
Pelé law
is a
Brazilian
law that forces
professional sports clubs
to observe business law and pay tax within two years.
Introduction
[
edit
]
On March 24, 1998, Law N. 9.615/98 stipulates that by 2001, clubs can sign a maximum five-year contract with a player when they turns 16 and stand to receive only a "penalty fee" of up to 100 times their monthly wage if they leaves before then. If a player fulfills the contract without renewing then they can leave and join a new club as a free agent.
[1]
The previous club receives no transfer fee or compensation in this transaction with the player's new club.
The introduction of Pelé law also permits the formation of independent leagues by sports clubs across Brazil, which was a notion not previously allowed under the governance of the
Brazilian Football Confederation
.

As referred to above, Pelé law regulates all aspects of sports in Brazil. This law embraces general rules about Brazilian sports law, regardless of the sports modality in question.
Due to its comprehensive nature we will restrict our analysis to the most controversial aspects. We will not discuss some aspects of Pelé law, such as disciplinary codes, Brazilian internal sports organization, sports courts composing, gambling regulations and other.
This analysis includes the following aspects: 
(i) establishment of leagues; 
(ii) establishment of for profit sports enterprise organizations; 
(iii) labor contracts rules; 
(iv) Arena; and 
(v) insurance policies for athletes.
Establishment of leagues
[
edit
]
Article 20 of Pelé law and its 5 subsections regulate the establishment of leagues. The caput of this article allows clubs that take part in any national or regional competition and are members of the Brazilian National Sports System to found leagues.
These leagues will be private legal entities, and may, among other issues, negotiate on behalf of their members, sponsorship agreements, advertising and broadcasting contracts.
The establishment of leagues must be notified to the national sports administration entities (“NSAE”) such as federations and confederations and such leagues are totally independent from the NSAE. Since the leagues are independent from the referred to entities, these are not allowed to interfere with the league private matters. Affiliation with a league does not imply in disaffiliation of the NSAE board. The club may participate in competitions organized by both entities, without legal restriction.
Arising form such legal permission, from 2001 football clubs started to organize themselves in leagues, which lead to the weakening of “CBF” (
Brazilian Football Confederation
) political power, for that body would no longer organize the Brazilian football championship, being left to organize solely the
Brazil Cup
, and being responsible for the
national team
.
However, aiming to avoid confrontation with CBF, and consequently with
FIFA
, as well as avoiding the possibility of being forbidden to take part in the
Copa Libertadores
, the teams taking part in the Brazilian Professional Football League agreed that the Brazilian Championship in 2002 will be organized and promoted by the League jointly with CBF.
Establishment of for-profit sports enterprise organizations
[
edit
]
According to articles 27 and 27A in Pelé law, any club - be it of football or not - has the right to shift into a corporation, such change not being mandatory. Differing from Spain and Portugal, there is no specific modality of a company destined exclusively to sports clubs in Brazil. There is no such a legal entity as called a "sports joint stock company".
In case a club should have the interest in a total change - or a change specifically in its football or volleyball department - into a corporation, the model adopted could be any of those as foreseen by law. That is, on deciding to change into a corporation, the club can make an option for a Stock Company, a Limited Liability Company, a Foundation, among other.
Following the established in FIFA Statute (article 7, N.5), taking into consideration the ENIC case, and aiming to reassure the "incertitude sportive", Law N. 9.981/00 has imposed a veto to any simultaneous participation of an individual or a corporation in the capital stock of two or more clubs disputing the same professional competition.
Such veto also embraces the joint ownership investments, indirect capital participation, and relatives ownership in sports clubs. The sponsorship in shirts and the administration of trademark and sports events ("stadiums") exploitation are counted out of this veto.
Weird as it can be, that same article brings the prohibition of companies granted with the exploitation of radio and television services, be it open television or cable, to sponsor any sports club.
Professional athlete's labor contract
[
edit
]
Article 28 of Pelé law stipulates the most relevant aspects of the professional athlete's labor contract (PALC), that are:
all labor contracts must be written and co-signed by athlete and a club, or a club enterprise;
have a specific and determinate term;
payment for the service must be clearly stated in the contract; and
penalty clause in cases of defaulting, breaching of contract and unilateral rescission of the contract.
The absence of any of above mentioned aspects will nullify the contract. A valid contract is formed only if both parties intend the act of signing to be the last act in the formation of a binding contract.
The requirement of a written contract implies that the athlete must be able to understand its terms and sign his or her name and also to avoid discussions about the existence of labor relation between the club and athlete.
The parties in a PALC must be an athlete and a club or a sports enterprise. This provision intends to hinder the action of agents. However, the law does not prohibit the ownership of a club by an agent.
The term of a PALC must be clearly stated in the contract, and pursuant to Article 30 of Pelé law the minimum term of a PALC is 3 (three) months and a maximum is 5 (five) years. However, a PALC may have its terms suspended if the athlete becomes unable to exercise his activity due to an occupational accident or disease, suffered in the club or while defending any team selection.
Article 31 of Pelé law provides that if the club has not effected partially or totally the payment for the services for 3 (three) consecutive months, the PALC can be rescinded by the athlete without the latter incurring in any fine. Moreover, pursuant article 32 of Pelé law, if the mentioned partial or total late payment lasts 2 (two) or more months, the athlete is allowed to stop playing for his team.
In case the athlete is asked to integrate the national or regional team, pursuant to article 41, the NSAE responsible for the national team shall be liable for the payment of the wages of the athletes for the services during the period that he/she will be under NSAE disposal.
The payment encompasses not only wages but also gratification, bonuses, benefits and reserves. Two other forms of payment may be included in the contract. These are known as (i) "bicho" and (ii) Arena. The Arena will be explained later.
"Bicho" is a money prize paid by the club to an athlete according to the team's performance, such as winning a championship, winning or drawing a match, qualifying to other championship phases, among others. The "bicho" may be established in the contract, but this is not usual.
Paragraph #2 of article 28 is one of the most controversial aspects of the Pelé law, once it has abolished the "passe". "Passe" was a legal determination that an athlete remains "tied" to the club even after the termination of a labor contract. Therefore, a tie-release amount was due to the club by another club if the latter wished to offer the athlete a new labor contract. Pursuant article 93 of Pelé law, the abolishment of "passe" only took effectiveness on March 24, 2001.
After the extinction of the "passe", what will keep the athlete bound to a football club is his labor contract, and at the final term of this the athlete will be free to change teams without payment of any indemnification whatsoever to his former club.
However, in case the athlete wishes to change clubs during the effectiveness of his contract, or in case the club wishes to release the athlete during the contract effectiveness, the payment of penalty for rescission shall be due, according to the contract provisions for such events.
According to paragraph 3 of article 38 in Pelé law, the amount of the penalty clause is freely established by the parties entering the contract, but shall be limited to 100 times the annual remuneration agreed to. Paragraph 4 of that same article establishes an automatic annual reduction on the penalty clause. On the first year of the accomplished contract, the penalty clause shall have a reduction of 10%; on the second year, the reduction shall be of 20%; on the third year, 40%; and on the fourth year, 80%.
It is important to note that according to Pelé law, the limit of the penalty clause and the referred to reductions will only be applicable in the transfers between Brazilian clubs. When such transfer occurs to foreign clubs, the amount of the penalty clause is of free stipulation.
There are two more exceptions to the amount of the penalty clause, being both of them only applicable in the event of the club having formed the player from its base categories:
In this case, the maximum amount for the penalty clause, in the rescission of a labor contract during its effectiveness, is no longer of 100 times the annual remuneration, but increases to 200 times such value; and
If at the end of the labor contract, for the period of 6 months as counted from the end of the contract, and provided the club continues paying that athlete's wages, the amount for the penalty clause can be up to 150 times the contracted annual remuneration.
Arena (broadcast rights)
[
edit
]
Arena is a right that the club has due to the use of its image during a match. The club has the right to negotiate the broadcasting of its matches and participation on championships as established in the caput of article 42 of Pelé law. However, pursuant to paragraph # 1 of the same article, 20% (twenty per cent) of the income related to the broadcasting of the matches must be equally distributed to all Athletes of the team.
The amounts received as transfer of the broadcasting rights are not considered wages, therefore they cannot be used as basis for calculation of the penalty clause established in article 28 of Pelé law as explained above.
Insurance policies for athletes
[
edit
]
Article 45 of Pelé law obliges the club to insure all its Athletes. The relevant insurance policies must cover personal and occupational accidents. Pelé law provides that the indemnity must correspond to the negotiated annual wages of the athlete.
Modifications to the law
[
edit
]
By Oct 2002, for being a controversial law, given it changed drastically the football culture in Brazil, Pelé law has been suffering mutilations since its promulgation. In less than 4 years of being in force, the law has already been through 3 major alterations, most of them based financial and political interests, never sports ones. Only 58% of the original text remains.

Austrian engineer and army officer
Eduard Lill
(1830-1900) was an
Austrian
engineer and army officer.
Life
[
edit
]
Lill was born 20 October 1830 in
Brüx
(
Bohemia
). From 1848 to 1849 he studied mathematics at the
Czech Technical University in Prague
and in 1850 he joined the military engineering corps of the
Austrian Empire
. From 1852 to 1856 he continued his education at the military engineering academy at Klosterbruck near
Znaim
. Later he was stationed in
Esseg
,
Kronstadt
and
Spalato
until he retired from his military career in 1868 with the rank of captain (
Hauptmann
) of the engineering corps. In the same year he became an engineer for the
Austrian Northwestern Railway
and oversaw the railroad construction at Trautenau (
Trutnov
). A severe accident however restricted him soon to office work. From 1872-1875 he worked as a secretary for the director of construction of the railway company. Later he became a technical consultant for company's headquarters and in 1885 the head of its statistics department. He retired in 1894 with the title of a
chief inspector
.
[1]
Work
[
edit
]
Lill is best remembered for a contribution in mathematics, and his traffic and transportation research. In mathematics he devised a graphical procedure to determine the
roots
of
polynomials
, which in essence is a  representation of
Horner's scheme
. He published his invention in 1867 in the French journal
Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques
, and
Charles Hermite
provided a description of it for the
Comptes rendus
of the same year. Later it became known as
Lill's method
.
[2]
Lill's transportation research led to what is now called
Lill's law of travel
(
Reisegesetz von Lill
). It was one of the first attempts to model the
quantity of travellers, in particular railroad passengers, between two locations
.
[3]
While it has been used in civilian engineering, in particular city planning, through much of 20th century, it is now typically replaced by more complex models.

Abbas Zakour
(
Arabic
:
عباس زكور
,
Hebrew
:
עבאס זכור
; born 30 December 1965) is an
Israeli Arab
politician and a former member of the
Knesset
for the
United Arab List
.
Biography
[
edit
]
Born in
Acre
, Zakour gained a BA in Islamic Sciences at the
Al-Quds University
in 1990. He later worked as director of the Almotak newspaper.
For the
2006 Knesset elections
, he was placed fourth on the
United Arab List
list,
[1]
and became a Knesset member when the party won four seats. In December 2008, he left the UAL and established a new party, the Arab Centre Party, to run in the
2009 Knesset elections
. Zakour stated that the party would join "any leftist government that supports peace", and hopes to win four seats.
[2]
Labor Party
MK
Raleb Majadele
was asked to head the party, but turned the offer down.
[3]
It was planned that Zakour would head the list, whilst former
United Arab List
and
Arab National Party
MK
Muhamad Kanan
would take second spot. However, Zakour later joined
Balad
, winning fourth place on its list,
[4]
and the new party did not run. Balad won three seats in the election, meaning Zakour lost his place in the Knesset.
In 2006, Zakour was stabbed and lightly wounded by a gang of Russian immigrants shouting anti-Arab chants. The attack was part of a "stabbing rampage", and was described as a "
hate crime
".
[5]
Zakour lives in Acre, and is married.

Živko Lukić
(
Serbian Cyrillic
: Живко Лукић; 1943/1944 - 2015) was a Serbian
footballer
who played as a
midfielder
.
[1]
He is known for being the first foreign player in
Paris Saint-Germain
history, making his way onto the team in a deceptive manner.
[2]
Career
[
edit
]
Lukić was a youth player for
Partizan
from 1961 to 1963. He made one appearance for the reserve team of the club on 6 June 1963, coming off the bench in a
friendly
against German club SV Merbeck.
[3]
In the space of seven years, from 1963 to 1970, Lukić went on to play for
Rijeka
,
Maribor
, and
Osijek
, while at the same time training to become a
dentist
.
[4]
In 1970,
Paris Saint-Germain
(PSG) was formed with the merging of
Paris FC
and
Stade Saint-Germain
; Lukić took advantage of the ambitious but not particularly organized project in
Paris
to hoax his way into the team. He tricked the entire PSG staff into believing that he had been an important player for Partizan in the past, and that he was the brother of
Rennes
player
Ilija Lukić
.
[4]
Up to this point, Lukić's plan was succeeding; he even received a welcome from the well-known magazine
France Football
several days before his debut for PSG.
[5]
On 29 August 1970, Lukić played in his first and only game with Paris Saint-Germain, coming on as a substitute in a 3-2
Division 2
win over
Quevilly
.
[6]
"His mission was to neutralise our opponent’s key player,
Horlaville
, whom we feared the most. And Lukić… he clung to him like an octopus to a rock! But Horlaville would quickly dribble past him once, then again, then make a pass, while my unfortunate Lukić would inevitably end up on his behind!" wrote former PSG president
Guy Crescent
in his 1992 autobiography.
[4]
Lukić only played a total of 53 minutes for PSG, and his deception was revealed after his appearance in a match. Despite his identity hoax, he was able to obtain a medal at the end of the season, as the Parisian club gained promotion to the
Division 1
in 1971.
[7]
Personal life and death
[
edit
]
After his football days, Lukić lived the rest of his life running a
dental clinic
in
Železnik
. The clinic closed in 2012.
[3]
He died in 2015.

Plot
[
edit
]
Yan-Dan is, originally, one of the twins of a rare four-leaf hanli twin lotus blossom, a relic of the ancients. Her body has been a treasure of medicinal cures since ancient times. She and her twin sister Zhi-Xi transformed into human form during the Jade Pool festival of the Supreme Emperor. The Demon clan tried to kidnap the lotus twins for their Emperor, to increase his Immortal powers. They are stopped by Lord Ying-Yuan who then gives the lotus twins their names. The twin lotus sisters had very different lifestyles. Zhi-Xi is always trying to better herself & elevate her status. Yan-Dan is not interested in cultivation or raising her status. She leaves it up to her sister to do it. She just wanted to write plays, relax, & enjoy a care-free life.
Zhi-Xi became assistant Curator at the Palace of Magical Pavilion & was despised by Curator Ying-Deng who made her life difficult. Yan-Dan was originally assigned to the Pavilion of Books, where she was writing a play about the War of Genesis Heroes, a war against Demons won by the collaboration of many mystical magical tribes. Many fought bravely & died during the war. One, in particular, had been forgotten & who contributed greatly to the war effort, the Nine Fin Tribe. Nine Fins descendant Yu Mo-Shan, from ancient times, was saved by Celestial Deity Bei-Ming who helped him attain human form through cultivation. He became friends with Yan-Dan & helped her with her play. While writing the play, Yan-Dan noticed someone kept flipping the Divine turtle onto his back & was determined to find out who was the culprit. She was unsuccessful, even though she tried many times & set many traps.
Yan-Dan helped Celestial Deity Bei-Ming, who was always kind to her, solve many chess problems sent by Lord Ying-Yuan. She was re-assigned to Yan-Xu Heavenly Palace by Lord Ying-Yuan to become his Immortal attendant, because of her expertise in chess. He realized Yan-Dan's potential & decided to train her, unbeknownst to her. He noted she was a quick & clever learner, but uninspired & lazy. He would punish her for any infractions, no matter how minor, by having her copy the heavenly scriptures numerous times. She felt like he was torturing her & complained constantly. She accidentally discovered demon spies. With help from Lord Ying-Yuan, the demon spies were vanquished.
Eventually, war between the Immortals & the Demons broke out. The Immortal army was commanded by the 4 Sovereign Lords, the Primordial Heavenly Emperor, Star Deity Huan-Qin, Celestial Deity Bei-Ming & Lord Ying-Yuan. The battle was fierce. Demons were using demon serpent Wu-Wang to try to destroy the pillars of Heaven. Yan-Dan, Yu Mo, & Li-Mu were in the palace of the main pillar of Heaven & saw it was crumbling. Yan-Dan used her Immortal powers to shore up the pillar with the help of Yu Mo & Li-Mu. Lord Ying-Yuan & Star Deity Huan-Qin fought Wu-Wang to stop it from destroying the pillars. During the battle, most of the leaders were killed, but the war was won, at great loss, & peace was restored to the Heavenly Realm. Celestial Deity Bei-Ming was bought back to his palace & was in great pain. Heavenly healers were unable to cure him. Yan-Dan & Yu Mo were by his side to try & comfort him in his pain. His Immortal spirit was damaged & shattered beyond repair. Yan-Dan used her lotus powers to bring him out of his delirium & calm him to a lucid state of mind. Yu Mo was Bei-Ming's disciple. Bei-Ming had used his magical Artifact to save Yu Mo as a promise to the Nine Fin tribe who he was great friends with. Yu Mo & Yan-Dan were able to bid Bei-Ming a tearful goodbye before he passed away. Lord Ying-Yuan was blinded & poisoned by the flame of Wu-Wang during the fight. The flame poison would make him go crazy & eventually, he would die. The only cure was the heart blood of a Four-leaf lotus. Lord Ying-Yuan refused to risk the life of the twin lotus sisters to save himself. He was ashamed of the great loss of his companions & other heavenly soldiers. He left in despair, went to the Land under the Horizon & chained himself to the sacred tree, to await death.
Yan-Dan was told Lord Ying-Yuan was traveling in the mortal world to recuperate. She accidentally came upon where Lord Ying-Yuan had chained himself to the sacred tree. She changed her voice, for fear he wouldn't speak to her, to talk to him to find out what had happened. She became very upset & sad on seeing his condition. She decided to find a cure for him, take care of him, & ease his pain. He realized, even though he was blind, it was Yan-Dan helping him. He kept pushing her away, but she refused to leave. While caring for him, they fell in love, but love relationships are against heavenly doctrines & punishable by death. Yan-Dan created a cottage next to the sacred tree, unchained Lord Ying-Yuan from the tree, & treated him with her lotus breath in the cottage which helped to alleviate the effects of the flame poison. He carved her a lotus blossom incense burner from agarwood. While helping the Divine turtle to go down to the mortal world, she, inadvertently, found out the cure for the flame poison. Using the Lucid Dream butterfly, Yan-Dan saw how much Lord Ying-Yuan was in love with her & she with him. She used half of her heart to cure Lord Ying-Yuan, because she couldn't bear to see him suffer in pain or die from the flame poison.
After Lord Ying-Yuan was cured, he was returned to Yan-Xu Heavenly palace. When he awoke, he had to act indifferent to Yan-Dan to keep her safe. Yan-Dan became upset because she thought Lord Ying-Yuan forgot his promises to her to recognize her when he awoke & smell the lotus blossoms in the pond in front of the cottage. She believed he cared for her sister Zhi-Xi as he was led to believe Zhi-Xi saved him, but Lord Ying-Yuan knew who really saved him & Zhi-Xi had lied about it. Zhi-Xi lied to him, because she wanted him to protect her from Curator Ying-Deng.
Curator Ying-Deng, with help from Zhi-Xi, frames Yan-Dan with poisoning her. She is sentenced to the punishment of fire by Lord Ying-Yuan at the Heavenly Gallows. Zhi-Xi is shocked by this outcome, she didn't expect Yan-Dan to be so severely punished & regretted helping Ying-Deng. Yan-Dan thinks Lord Ying-Yuan despises her, but he works to save her and with help from Marshal Hou-Den, gets a decree of immunity & sets her up in Xuan-Xin Cliffs palace. He requests Marshal Hou-De to accept Yan-Dan as his disciple to which he agrees to wholeheartedly. Zhi-Xi visits Yan-Dan in prison, hoping to clear up all the misunderstandings. Zhi-Xi regrets all her mistakes, but it's too late to do anything.
On the day of the punishment, Lord Ying-Yuan takes Yan-Dan up to the Heavenly Gallows. Yan-Dan asks Lord Ying-Yuan if he believes she was framed, he tells her he can only carry out the punishment. Yan-Dan, in despair, jumps off the Bridge of Nothingness. Lord Ying-Yuan jumps in after her & saves her. Her Immortal spirit is destroyed & she must cross over the Night Forgetting River to enter the mortal world. In order to cross over, she must let go of all her past memories & feelings. She is given a lit lantern holding her memories, is told when the light goes out and that when all memories & feelings are let go, she can enter the mortal world. When Lord Ying-Yuan returns to the Heavenly Realm, he presents himself to the Supreme Emperor for punishment of having a love relationship & survives it when most other deities would have perished.
Curator Ying-Deng creates a fake record to Zhi-Xi saying Yan-Dan has crossed the river, giving false hope to Lord Ying-Yuan, Zhi-Xi, Yu Mo, & her friend Lu-Ming. Curator wants Yan-Dan to disintegrate into ashes & to see the face of Lord Ying-Yuan's face when it happens. Lord Ying-Yuan believes Yan-Dan has crossed over & works to restore order to the Heavenly Realm. After vanquishing the remnant demons in the Heavenly realm, he discovers from the Imperial Heavenly Soldiers, during the war, a deity used her Immortal powers to hold up the heavenly pillar as it was crumbling. He realizes it was done by Yan-Dan because of the scent of lotus blossoms & uses his Immortal powers to reinforce the pillar, then he faints away into a coma. He is bought to his cottage to recuperate.
Yan-Dan spent over 800 years of her life attempting to forget Lord Ying-Yuan while attempting to cross the Night Forgetting River to enter the mortal world. Lord Ying-Yuan has been in a coma for 800 years. Li-Mu, who is now assistant to the Supreme Emperor, comes across a report sent by a Hell guard of people who haven't crossed the Night Forgetting River. The report shows Yan-Dan has not crossed over yet. He runs to Lord Ying-Yuan in the cottage to let him know, but he is still in a coma. With help from Zhi-Xi, Lord Ying-Yuan wakes up from his coma. Li-Mu tells him if Yan-Dan doesn't cross over within 900 years time, she will turn to ash. She only has 3 days left. Using the sonic beetle, Curator Ying-Deng overhears what Li-Mu has told Lord Ying-Yuan and finds out Yan-Dan has not crossed the river & plots to have her killed.
Lord Ying-Yuan tries to save Yan-Dan from turning to ashes. He receives permission from the Supreme Emperor to go & save Yan-Dan after he self-punishes himself for defying the Emperor, harming the Imperial Heavenly guards, & having a love relationship. He helps Yan-Dan, who is now partially blind & suffering from attempts to enter the mortal world by trying to cross the Night Forgetting River. He is alarmed by her appearance & his heart aches for her. He changes his voice to the Hell guard's voice, so she won't know he is helping her. He arranges for her to fall through a hole he creates in the river to reach the mortal world, 
but is interrupted by the King of Hell, Ning Wang, who believes if he uses the four leaf lotus, it will cure his illness as was told to him by Curator Ying-Deng through use of the sonic beetle. Lord Ying-Yuan easily defeats Ning Wang, but he finds out the other 3 sovereign lords, Star Deity, & Celestial Deity did not die as was recorded in the historical heavenly annals. He, firstly, performs a difficult spell to help Yan-Dan forget him, so she can enter the mortal world.  He succeeds & Yan-Dan is sent to the mortal world.
Lord Ying-Yuan is ambushed by a dark figure who he fights off only to realize it was to keep him from further questioning Ning Wang. On arriving to the jail where Ning Wang was kept, he discovers Ning Wang was killed by having his internal core crushed. He sees the sonic beetle & destroys it. Lord Ying-Yuan reports to Supreme Emperor the deaths of his colleagues are not as recorded. He requests to go to the mortal world to find the Demons who escaped there & interrogate them to find out the truth about what had actually happened to his colleagues during the war. The Supreme Emperor grants his request & to cover up the investigation he announces Lord Ying-Yuan will be sent down to the mortal world for further penance. Before Lord Ying-Yuan leaves, he grants Yan-Dan's wish for her sister, Zhi-Xi, to ascend.
In order to find Yan-Dan's reincarnation, Yu Mo-Shan (last descendant of the Nine Fin tribe) escapes to the mortal world with help from Zhao-Lan, Princess of the South Seas Dragon clan. On arrival into the mortal world, he starts to search for Yan-Dan. He doesn't know she has not been able to cross the Night Forgetting River. He searches for her for almost 900 years & can't find her, but knows she is still alive because of the sigil on his arm, given to him by Yan-Dan while he was still working on keeping his human form at Xuan-Xin Cliffs. Ao-Yang, Prince of the East Seas Dragon clan, attacks Yu Mo after finding out he is a descendant of the Nine Fin tribe who used to rule the seas as they can control fire & water. Another fight is joined with his, Zi-Lin who is being chased by Qiu-Yi's group. During the fight, Yu Mo is injured by the soul-crashing hook used by Ao-Yang, given to him by his father. Zi-Lin helps Yu Mo escape, realizes Yu Mo is seriously injured & brings him to Qiu-Yi's magical springs where he is healed. Yu Mo helps Zi-Lin defeat the terrible tyrant lizard spirit Qiu-Yi & reluctantly, becomes co-ruler of Ye-Lan mountain, whose magical hot springs can cure all & has power boosting abilities, with Zi-Lin.
Yu Mo became a powerful ally for Yan-Dan when she starts her life after descending into the mortal world. It took a while for Yu Mo to find Yan-Dan. 
Ye-Lan Mountains also became their stable home together. Yan-Dan doesn't remember anything of her previous life, but she still wants to be the best playwright. In order to help Yan-Dan realize her wish, Yu Mo takes her to travel around the world, to "do one good deed every day" & experience life.
Tang Zhou (Lord Ying-Yuan mortal form/life), disciple of Ling Xiao sect of Taoism specializing in exorcism, left the sect to go out & gain experience of the world outside. After Tang Zhou is attacked, his Celestial vest is damaged. Li-Mu, who is monitoring Lord Ying-Yuan's progress, saw Tang Zhou was knocked out & ran over to revive him. Li-Mu tells him he used to be the sovereign lord & needs to repair his vest or his God Powers will destroy his body. In order to repair his vest, he needs to find the 4 Divine artifacts: 7 Luminious jade, Li Chen, Chu Mo, & Earthstop. While Yan-Dan was punishing an evil deed, she encountered detainment & persecution from Demon Slayer Tang Zhou. This starts a journey in which Yan-Dan and Tang Zhou both fought evil using wits, spells, & creativity. Shared woe, love, betrayal, hate, greed, loss, etc. She helps Tang Zhou find the four Divine artifacts needed to repair his Celestial vest. Tang Zhou, Yan-Dan, and Yu Mo discovered one mysterious thing after another. Finding the 4 divine artifacts, they discover more mysteries behind the events of the "War of Genesis", the "Divine-Demon war" & the deaths of the 3 Sovereign Lords, Celestial Deity Bei-Ming & Star Deity Huan-Qin.  Involving also the safety of all 3 Realms.

Professional gambler
Nikolaos Andreas Dandolos
(
Greek
:
Νικόλαος Ανδρέας Δάνδολος
[niˈko.la.os
anˈðɾe.as
ˈðan.ðo.los]
; April 27, 1883 - December 25, 1966), commonly known as
Nick the Greek
, was a Greek professional
gambler
and
high roller
.
Early life
[
edit
]
Dandolos was the son of wealthy parents. He attended the Greek Evangelical College and earned a degree in
philosophy
. When he was 18 years old, his grandfather sent him to the
United States
with an allowance of $150 per week. Although Dandolos settled in
Chicago
he eventually moved to
Montreal
where he began gambling on horse races.
Dandolos was known throughout his life for winning and losing large sums of money. After winning over $500,000 on horse racing, he moved back to Chicago where he lost it all on card and dice games. He quickly became a master of these games, however, and became a prime attraction at
casinos
when he would play in them.
Poker and gambling
[
edit
]
From January 1949 to May 1949, Dandolos played a two-person "heads up"
poker
match against poker legend
Johnny Moss
where the two played virtually every variation of the game that existed at the time. The game, set up by
Benny Binion
as a tourist attraction, is widely credited as being the inspiration for the modern day
World Series of Poker
.
At the end of this five-month poker marathon, down an estimated $2-4 million, Dandolos uttered what has become one of the most famous poker quotes ever: "Mr. Moss, I have to let you go."
[1]
One
urban legend
claims that Dandolos once had the opportunity to escort
Albert Einstein
around
Las Vegas
. Thinking that his gambling friends may not be familiar with him, Dandolos allegedly introduced Einstein as "Little Al from
Princeton
" and stated that he "controlled a lot of the numbers action around
Jersey
."

According to Dandolos's own testimony in
Gambling Secrets of Nick the Greek
, just before the end of World War II, he got a call from a friend at the US State Department. The caller said that there was someone who was looking for a poker game on a weekend in Manhattan. Dandolos reminded his friend that gambling is illegal in New York, but his friend said that he would see to it that no law enforcement would get involved. At the game, according to Dandolos, he introduced Albert Einstein as "Little Al from Jersey."
Another urban legend has him winning one million dollars against a Texan. In the early hours of the morning, Dandolos felt tired and called an end to the game. The Texan accused him of chickening out while the going was good. Dandolos then called for a new deck of cards, shuffled them and asked the Texan if he wanted to cut the cards (high card wins) one time, for double or quit. The Texan declined and they went home.

Nobel Prize-winning physicist
Richard Feynman
also met Dandolos, according to the autobiographical
Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!
. Dandolos explained how he won big not by playing the tables, but by knowing the odds at the tables and betting against others who have
superstitious
beliefs about the outcome. He then relied on his reputation to bet against others.

Later life
[
edit
]
Near the end of his life, Dandolos was near-broke and playing $5 limit draw poker games in
Gardena
,
California
. When asked by a fellow player how he could once play for millions and now be playing for such small stakes, Dandolos supposedly replied, "Hey, it's action, isn't it?".
Death
[
edit
]
He died on
Christmas Day
in 1966 and was a charter inductee of the
Poker Hall of Fame
in 1979.
Legacy
[
edit
]
It's estimated
[
by whom?
]
that he won and lost over $500 million in his lifetime. He himself claimed that he went from rags to riches over 73 times. He donated over $20 million to education and charity.
[2]
A book by Ted Thackrey was published in 1968 titled
Gambling Secrets of Nick the Greek
.
A novel about Dandolos' life was written by
Harry Mark Petrakis
in 1978 titled
Nick the Greek
.
A song about Dandolos titled "The Great Dandolos" was included in 2014
Vigilante
, a record by a Greek band called Planet of Zeus.
In popular culture
[
edit
]
In the
Damon Runyon
short story, "Romance in the Roaring Forties", Dandolos is mentioned by name, as a guest at the Prohibition-era New York wedding of Miss Billy Perry. Other guests are Waldo Winchester (a thinly-disguised
Walter Winchell
), Skeets Boliver, Feet Samuels, and Good Time Charley Bernstein, showing Dandolos as part of the louche guys-and-dolls culture of Broadway in the Roaring Twenties.
He also appears in Runyon's short story "Blood Pressure", playing at Nathan Detroit's floating crap game in New York. The unnamed narrator has been dragged into the game by a gangster, and notes that it is more than somewhat full of very tough guys indeed, there with some of the towns highest rollers:
[3]
But there they are wedged up against the table with Nick the Greek, Big Nig, Grey John, Okay Okun, and many other high shots, and they all have big coarse G notes [thousand dollar bills] in their hands which they are tossing around back and forth as if these G notes are nothing but pieces of waste paper.
A brief appearance is made by Dandolos at a party in Runyon's short story "Madame La Gimp", where he impersonates
Heywood Broun
.
In "
Shotgun
", the fifth episode in the fourth season of American
crime drama
television series
Breaking Bad
,
Walter White
gets called "Nick the Greek" by his brother-in-law
Hank Schrader
, as the latter thought that the former won a lot of money by playing
blackjack
with a special strategy.

Instructions to be executed by a computer
For the TV program, see
The Computer Programme
.
Source code
for a computer program written in the
HTML
and
JavaScript
languages
A
computer program
is a
sequence
or set of instructions in a
programming language
for a
computer
to
execute
. It is one component of
software
, which also includes
documentation
and other intangible components.
[1]
A
computer program
in its human-readable form is called
source code
. Source code needs another computer program to
execute
because computers can only execute their native
machine instructions
. Therefore, source code may be translated to machine instructions using the language's
compiler
. (
Assembly language
programs are translated using an
assembler
.) The resulting file is called an
executable
. Alternatively, source code may execute within the language's
interpreter
.
[2]
If the executable is requested for execution, then the
operating system
loads
it into
memory
and starts a
process
.
[3]
The
central processing unit
will soon
switch
to this process so it can
fetch, decode, and then execute
each machine instruction.
[4]
If the source code is requested for execution, then the operating system loads the corresponding interpreter into memory and starts a process. The interpreter then loads the source code into memory to translate and execute each
statement
.
[2]
Running the source code is slower than running an executable.
[a]
Moreover, the interpreter must be installed on the computer.
Example computer program

"Hello, World!" program
by
Brian Kernighan
(1978)
The
"Hello, World!" program
is used to illustrate a language's basic
syntax
. The syntax of the language
BASIC
(1964) was intentionally limited to make the language easy to learn.
[5]
For example,
variables
are not
declared
before being used.
[6]
Also, variables are automatically initialized to zero.
[6]
Here is an example computer program, in Basic, to
average
a list of numbers:
[7]
10
INPUT
"How many numbers to average?"
,
A
20
FOR
I
=
1
TO
A
30
INPUT
"Enter number:"
,
B
40
LET
C
=
C
+
B
50
NEXT
I
60
LET
D
=
C
/
A
70
PRINT
"The average is"
,
D
80
END
Once the mechanics of basic computer programming are learned, more sophisticated and powerful languages are available to build large computer systems.

changed dramatically.
Analytical Engine
[
edit
]
Lovelace's description from Note G
In 1837,
Jacquard's loom
inspired
Charles Babbage
to attempt to build the
Analytical Engine
.
[9]
The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry. In the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled. The device had a "store" which consisted of memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 50 decimal digits each.
[10]
Numbers from the "store" were transferred to the "mill" for processing. It was programmed using two sets of perforated cards. One set directed the operation and the other set inputted the variables.
[9]
[11]
However, the thousands of cogged wheels and gears never fully worked together, even after Babbage spent more than £17,000 of government money.
[12]
Ada Lovelace
worked for Charles Babbage to create a description of the Analytical Engine (1843).
[13]
The description contained Note G which completely detailed a method for calculating
Bernoulli numbers
using the Analytical Engine. This note is recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program.
[12]
Other historians consider Babbage himself wrote the first computer program for the Analytical Engine. It listed a sequence of operations to compute the solution for a system of two linear equations.
[14]
Universal Turing machine
[
edit
]
In 1936,
Alan Turing
introduced the
Universal Turing machine
, a theoretical device that can model every computation.
[15]
It is a
finite-state machine
that has an infinitely long read/write tape. The machine can move the tape back and forth, changing its contents as it performs an
algorithm
. The machine starts in the initial state, goes through a sequence of steps, and halts when it encounters the halt state.
[16]
All present-day computers are
Turing complete
.
[17]
ENIAC
[
edit
]
Glenn A. Beck changing a tube in ENIAC
The
Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer
(ENIAC) was built between July 1943 and Fall 1945. It was a
Turing complete
, general-purpose computer that used 17,468
vacuum tubes
to create the
circuits
. At its core, it was a series of
Pascalines
wired together.
[18]
Its 40 units weighed 30 tons, occupied 1,800 square feet (167 m
2
), and consumed $650 per hour (
in 1940s currency
) in electricity when idle.
[18]
It had 20
base-10
accumulators
. Programming the ENIAC took up to two months.
[18]
Three function tables were on wheels and needed to be rolled to fixed function panels. Function tables were connected to function panels by plugging heavy black cables into
plugboards
. Each function table had 728 rotating knobs. Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week.
[19]
It ran from 1947 until 1955 at
Aberdeen Proving Ground
, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.
[20]
Stored-program computers
[
edit
]
Instead of plugging in cords and turning switches, a
stored-program computer
loads its instructions into
memory
just like it loads its data into memory.
[21]
As a result, the computer could be programmed quickly and perform calculations at very fast speeds.
[22]
Presper Eckert
and
John Mauchly
built the ENIAC. The two engineers introduced the
stored-program concept
in a three-page memo dated February 1944.
[23]
Later, in September 1944,
Dr. John von Neumann
began working on the ENIAC project. On June 30, 1945, von Neumann published the
First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC
, which equated the structures of the computer with the structures of the human brain.
[22]
The design became known as the
von Neumann architecture
. The architecture was simultaneously deployed in the constructions of the
EDVAC
and
EDSAC
computers in 1949.
[24]
The
IBM System/360
(1964) was a family of computers, each having the same
instruction set architecture
. The
Model 20
was the smallest and least expensive. Customers could upgrade and retain the same
application software
.
[25]
The
Model 195
was the most premium.  Each System/360 model featured
multiprogramming
[25]
—having multiple
processes
in
memory
at once. When one process was waiting for
input/output
, another could compute.
IBM planned for each model to be programmed using
PL/1
.
[26]
A committee was formed that included
COBOL
,
Fortran
and
ALGOL
programmers. The purpose was to develop a language that was comprehensive, easy to use, extendible, and would replace Cobol and Fortran.
[26]
The result was a large and complex language that took a long time to
compile
.
[27]
Switches for manual input on a
Data General Nova
3, manufactured in the mid-1970s
Computers manufactured until the 1970s had front-panel switches for manual programming.
[28]
The computer program was written on paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were automatically inputted via
paper tape
,
punched cards
or
magnetic-tape
. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches, and the execute button was pressed.
[28]
Very Large Scale Integration
[
edit
]
A VLSI integrated-circuit
die
A major milestone in software development was the invention of the
Very Large Scale Integration
(VLSI) circuit (1964).
[29]
Following
World War II
, tube-based technology was replaced with
point-contact transistors
(1947) and
bipolar junction transistors
(late 1950s) mounted on a
circuit board
.
[29]
During the 1960s
, the
aerospace
industry replaced the circuit board with an
integrated circuit chip
.
[29]
Robert Noyce
, co-founder of
Fairchild Semiconductor
(1957) and
Intel
(1968), achieved a technological improvement to refine the
production
of
field-effect transistors
(1963).
[30]
The goal is to alter the
electrical resistivity and conductivity
of a
semiconductor junction
. First, naturally occurring
silicate minerals
are converted into
polysilicon
rods using the
Siemens process
.
[31]
The
Czochralski process
then converts the rods into a
monocrystalline silicon
,
boule crystal
.
[32]
The
crystal
is then thinly sliced to form a
wafer
substrate
. The
planar process
of
photolithography
then
integrates
unipolar transistors,
capacitors
,
diodes
, and
resistors
onto the wafer to build a matrix of
metal-oxide-semiconductor
(MOS) transistors.
[33]
[34]
The MOS transistor is the primary component in
integrated circuit chips
.
[30]
Originally, integrated circuit chips had their function set during manufacturing. During the 1960s, controlling the electrical flow migrated to programming a
matrix
of
read-only memory
(ROM). The matrix resembled a two-dimensional array of fuses.
[29]
The process to embed instructions onto the matrix was to burn out the unneeded connections.
[29]
There were so many connections,
firmware
programmers wrote a
computer program
on another chip to oversee the burning.
[29]
The technology became known as
Programmable ROM
. In 1971, Intel
installed the computer program onto the chip
and named it the
Intel 4004
microprocessor
.
[35]
IBM's System/360 (1964) CPU was not a microprocessor.
The terms
microprocessor
and
central processing unit
(CPU) are now used interchangeably. However, CPUs predate microprocessors. For example, the
IBM System/360
(1964) had a CPU made from
circuit boards containing discrete components on ceramic substrates
.
[36]
Sac State 8008
[
edit
]
Artist's depiction of Sacramento State University's Intel 8008 microcomputer (1972)
The Intel 4004 (1971) was a 4-
bit
microprocessor designed to run the
Busicom
calculator. Five months after its release, Intel released the
Intel 8008
, an 8-bit microprocessor. Bill Pentz led a team at
Sacramento State
to build the first
microcomputer
using the Intel 8008: the
Sac State 8008
(1972).
[37]
Its purpose was to store patient medical records. The computer supported a
disk operating system
to run a
Memorex
, 3-
megabyte
,
hard disk drive
.
[29]
It had a color display and keyboard that was packaged in a single console. The disk operating system was programmed using
IBM's Basic Assembly Language (BAL)
. The medical records application was programmed using a
BASIC
interpreter.
[29]
However, the computer was an evolutionary dead-end because it was extremely expensive. Also, it was built at a public university lab for a specific purpose.
[37]
Nonetheless, the project contributed to the development of the
Intel 8080
(1974)
instruction set
.
[29]
x86 series
[
edit
]
The original
IBM Personal Computer
(1981) used an Intel 8088 microprocessor.
In 1978, the modern software development environment began when Intel upgraded the
Intel 8080
to the
Intel 8086
. Intel simplified the Intel 8086 to manufacture the cheaper
Intel 8088
.
[38]
IBM
embraced the Intel 8088 when they entered the
personal computer
market (1981). As
consumer
demand
for personal computers increased, so did Intel's microprocessor development. The succession of development is known as the
x86 series
. The
x86 assembly language
is a family of
backward-compatible
machine instructions
. Machine instructions created in earlier microprocessors were retained throughout microprocessor upgrades. This enabled consumers to purchase new computers without having to purchase new
application software
.  The major categories of instructions are:
[b]
Memory instructions to set and access numbers and
strings
in
random-access memory
.
Integer
arithmetic logic unit
(ALU) instructions to perform the primary arithmetic operations on
integers
.
Floating point ALU instructions to perform the primary arithmetic operations on
real numbers
.
Call stack
instructions to push and pop
words
needed to allocate memory and interface with
functions
.
Single instruction, multiple data
(SIMD) instructions
[c]
to increase speed when multiple processors are available to perform the same
algorithm
on an
array of data
.
Changing programming environment
[
edit
]
The
DEC
VT100
(1978) was a widely used
computer terminal
.
VLSI circuits enabled the
programming environment
to advance from a
computer terminal
(until the 1990s) to a
graphical user interface
(GUI) computer. Computer terminals limited programmers to a single
shell
running in a
command-line environment
. During the 1970s, full-screen source code editing became possible through a
text-based user interface
. Regardless of the technology available, the goal is to program in a
programming language
.
Programming paradigms and languages
[
edit
]
Programming language
features exist to provide building blocks to be combined to express programming ideals.
[39]
Ideally, a programming language should:
[39]
express ideas directly in the code.
express independent ideas independently.
express relationships among ideas directly in the code.
combine ideas freely.
combine ideas only where combinations make sense.
express simple ideas simply.
The programming style of a programming language to provide these building blocks may be categorized into
programming paradigms
.
[40]
For example, different paradigms may differentiate:
[40]
procedural languages
,
functional languages
, and
logical languages
.
different levels of
data abstraction
.
different levels of
class hierarchy
.
different levels of input
datatypes
, as in
container types
and
generic programming
.
Each of these programming styles has contributed to the synthesis of different
programming languages
.
[40]
A
programming language
is a set of
keywords
,
symbols
,
identifiers
, and rules by which programmers can communicate instructions to the computer.
[41]
They follow a set of rules called a
syntax
.
[41]
Keywords
are reserved words to form
declarations
and
statements
.
Symbols
are characters to form
operations
,
assignments
,
control flow
, and
delimiters
.
Identifiers
are words created by programmers to form
constants
,
variable names
,
structure names
, and
function names
.
Syntax Rules
are defined in the
Backus-Naur form
.
Programming languages
get their basis from
formal languages
.
[42]
The purpose of defining a solution in terms of its
formal language
is to generate an
algorithm
to solve the underlining problem.
[42]
An
algorithm
is a sequence of simple instructions that solve a problem.
[43]
Generations of programming language
[
edit
]
Main article:
Programming language generations
The evolution of programming language began when the
EDSAC
(1949) used the first
stored computer program
in its
von Neumann architecture
.
[44]
Programming the EDSAC was in the first
generation of programming language
.
The
first generation of programming language
is
machine language
.
[45]
Machine language
requires the programmer to enter instructions using
instruction numbers
called
machine code
. For example, the ADD operation on the
PDP-11
has instruction number 24576.
[46]
The
second generation of programming language
is
assembly language
.
[45]
Assembly language
allows the programmer to use
mnemonic
instructions instead of remembering instruction numbers. An
assembler
translates each assembly language mnemonic into its machine language number. For example, on the PDP-11, the operation 24576 can be referenced as ADD in the source code.
[46]
The four basic arithmetic operations have assembly instructions like ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV.
[46]
Computers also have instructions like DW (Define
Word
) to reserve
memory
cells. Then the MOV instruction can copy
integers
between
registers
and memory.
The basic structure of an assembly language statement is a label,
operation
,
operand
, and comment.
[47]
Labels
allow the programmer to work with
variable names
. The assembler will later translate labels into physical
memory addresses
.
Operations
allow the programmer to work with mnemonics. The assembler will later translate mnemonics into instruction numbers.
Operands
tell the assembler which data the operation will process.
Comments
allow the programmer to articulate a narrative because the instructions alone are vague.
The key characteristic of an assembly language program is it forms a one-to-one mapping to its corresponding machine language target.
[48]
The
third generation of programming language
uses
compilers
and
interpreters
to execute computer programs. The distinguishing feature of a
third generation
language is its independence from particular hardware.
[49]
Early languages include
Fortran
(1958),
COBOL
(1959),
ALGOL
(1960), and
BASIC
(1964).
[45]
In 1973, the
C programming language
emerged as a
high-level language
that produced efficient machine language instructions.
[50]
Whereas
third-generation
languages historically generated many machine instructions for each statement,
[51]
C has statements that may generate a single machine instruction.
[d]
Moreover, an
optimizing compiler
might overrule the programmer and produce fewer machine instructions than statements. Today, an entire
paradigm
of languages fill the
imperative
,
third generation
spectrum.
The
fourth generation of programming language
emphasizes what output results are desired, rather than how programming statements should be constructed.
[45]
Declarative languages
attempt to limit
side effects
and allow programmers to write code with relatively few errors.
[45]
One popular
fourth generation
language is called
Structured Query Language
(SQL).
[45]
Database
developers no longer need to process each database record one at a time. Also, a simple statement can generate output records without having to understand how they are retrieved.
Imperative languages
[
edit
]
Main article:
Imperative programming
A computer program written in an imperative language
Imperative languages
specify a sequential
algorithm
using
declarations
,
expressions
, and
statements
:
[52]
A
declaration
introduces a
variable
name to the
computer program
and assigns it to a
datatype
[53]
- for example:
var x: integer;
An
expression
yields a value - for example:
2 + 2
yields 4
A
statement
might
assign
an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's
control flow
- for example:
x := 2 + 2;
if
x = 4 then do_something();
Fortran
[
edit
]
FORTRAN
(1958) was unveiled as "The IBM Mathematical FORmula TRANslating system." It was designed for scientific calculations, without
string
handling facilities. Along with
declarations
,
expressions
, and
statements
, it supported:
arrays
.
subroutines
.
"do" loops
.
It succeeded because:
programming and debugging costs were below computer running costs.
it was supported by IBM.
applications at the time were scientific.
[54]
However, non-IBM vendors also wrote Fortran compilers, but with a syntax that would likely fail IBM's compiler.
[54]
The
American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) developed the first Fortran standard in 1966. In 1978, Fortran 77 became the standard until 1991. Fortran 90 supports:
records
.
pointers
to arrays.
COBOL
[
edit
]
COBOL
(1959) stands for "COmmon Business Oriented Language." Fortran manipulated symbols. It was soon realized that symbols did not need to be numbers, so
strings
were introduced.
[55]
The
US Department of Defense
influenced COBOL's development, with
Grace Hopper
being a major contributor. The statements were English-like and verbose. The goal was to design a language so managers could read the programs. However, the lack of structured statements hindered this goal.
[56]
COBOL's development was tightly controlled, so dialects did not emerge to require ANSI standards. As a consequence, it was not changed for 15 years until 1974. The 1990s version did make consequential changes, like
object-oriented programming
.
[56]
Algol
[
edit
]
ALGOL
(1960) stands for "ALGOrithmic Language." It had a profound influence on programming language design.
[57]
Emerging from a committee of European and American programming language experts, it used standard mathematical notation and had a readable, structured design. Algol was first to define its
syntax
using the
Backus-Naur form
.
[57]
This led to
syntax-directed
compilers. It added features like:
block structure
, where variables were local to their block.
arrays with variable bounds.
"for" loops
.
functions
.
recursion
.
[57]
Algol's direct descendants include
Pascal
,
Modula-2
,
Ada
,
Delphi
and
Oberon
on one branch. On another branch the descendants include
C
,
C++
and
Java
.
[57]
Basic
[
edit
]
BASIC
(1964) stands for "Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code." It was developed at
Dartmouth College
for all of their students to learn.
[7]
If a student did not go on to a more powerful language, the student would still remember Basic.
[7]
A Basic interpreter was installed in the
microcomputers
manufactured in the late 1970s. As the microcomputer industry grew, so did the language.
[7]
Basic pioneered the
interactive session
.
[7]
It offered
operating system
commands within its environment:
The 'new' command created an empty slate.
Statements evaluated immediately.
Statements could be programmed by preceding them with a line number.
The 'list' command displayed the program.
The 'run' command executed the program.
However, the Basic syntax was too simple for large programs.
[7]
Recent dialects added structure and object-oriented extensions.
Microsoft's
Visual Basic
is still widely used and produces a
graphical user interface
.
[6]
C
[
edit
]
C programming language
(1973) got its name because the language
BCPL
was replaced with
B
, and
AT&T Bell Labs
called the next version "C." Its purpose was to write the
UNIX
operating system
.
[50]
C is a relatively small language, making it easy to write compilers. Its growth mirrored the hardware growth in the 1980s.
[50]
Its growth also was because it has the facilities of
assembly language
, but uses a
high-level syntax
. It added advanced features like:
inline assembler
.
arithmetic on pointers.
pointers to functions.
bit operations.
freely combining complex
operators
.
[50]
Computer memory map
C
allows the programmer to control which region of memory data is to be stored.
Global variables
and
static variables
require the fewest
clock cycles
to store. The
stack
is automatically used for the standard variable
declarations
.
Heap
memory is returned to a
pointer variable
from the
malloc()
function.
The
global and static data
region is located just above the
program
region. (The program region is technically called the
text
region. It's where machine instructions are stored.)
The global and static data region is technically two regions.
[58]
One region is called the
initialized
data segment
, where variables declared with default values are stored. The other region is called the
block started by segment
, where variables declared without default values are stored.
Variables stored in the
global and static data
region have their
addresses
set at compile-time. They retain their values throughout the life of the process.
The global and static region stores the
global variables
that are declared on top of (outside) the
main()
function.
[59]
Global variables are visible to
main()
and every other function in the source code.
On the other hand, variable declarations inside of
main()
, other functions, or within
{
}
block delimiters
are
local variables
. Local variables also include
formal parameter
variables
. Parameter variables are enclosed within the parenthesis of function definitions.
[60]
They provide an
interface
to the function.
Local variables
declared using the
static
prefix are also stored in the
global and static data
region.
[58]
Unlike global variables, static variables are only visible within the function or block. Static variables always retain their value. An example usage would be the function
int increment_counter(){static int counter = 0; counter++; return counter;}
[e]
The
stack
region is a contiguous block of memory located near the top memory address.
[61]
Variables placed in the stack are populated from top to bottom.
[f]
[61]
A
stack pointer
is a special-purpose
register
that keeps track of the last memory address populated.
[61]
Variables are placed into the stack via the
assembly language
PUSH instruction. Therefore, the addresses of these variables are set during
runtime
. The method for stack variables to lose their
scope
is via the POP instruction.
Local variables
declared without the
static
prefix, including formal parameter variables,
[62]
are called
automatic variables
[59]
and are stored in the stack.
[58]
They are visible inside the function or block and lose their scope upon exiting the function or block.
The
heap
region is located below the stack.
[58]
It is populated from the bottom to the top. The
operating system
manages the heap using a
heap pointer
and a list of allocated memory blocks.
[63]
Like the stack, the addresses of heap variables are set during runtime. An
out of memory
error occurs when the heap pointer and the stack pointer meet.
C
provides the
malloc()
library function to
allocate
heap memory.
[64]
Populating the heap with data is an additional copy function. Variables stored in the heap are economically passed to functions using pointers. Without pointers, the entire block of data would have to be passed to the function via the stack.
C++
[
edit
]
In the 1970s,
software engineers
needed language support to break large projects down into
modules
.
[65]
One obvious feature was to decompose large projects
physically
into separate
files
. A less obvious feature was to decompose large projects
logically
into
abstract data types
.
[65]
At the time, languages supported
concrete (scalar)
datatypes like
integer
numbers,
floating-point
numbers, and
strings
of
characters
. Abstract datatypes are
structures
of concrete datatypes, with a new name assigned. For example, a
list
of integers could be called
integer_list
.
In object-oriented jargon, abstract datatypes are called
classes
. However, a
class
is only a definition; no memory is allocated. When memory is allocated to a class and
bound
to an
identifier
, it's called an
object
.
[66]
Object-oriented imperative languages
developed by combining the need for classes and the need for safe
functional programming
.
[67]
A function, in an object-oriented language, is assigned to a class. An assigned function is then referred to as a
method
,
member function
, or
operation
.
Object-oriented programming
is executing
operations
on
objects
.
[68]
Object-oriented languages
support a syntax to model
subset/superset
relationships. In
set theory
, an
element
of a subset inherits all the attributes contained in the superset. For example, a student is a person. Therefore, the set of students is a subset of the set of persons. As a result, students inherit all the attributes common to all persons. Additionally, students have unique attributes that other people do not have.
Object-oriented languages
model
subset/superset
relationships using
inheritance
.
[69]
Object-oriented programming
became the dominant language paradigm by the late 1990s.
[65]
C++
(1985) was originally called "C with Classes."
[70]
It was designed to expand
C's
capabilities by adding the object-oriented facilities of the language
Simula
.
[71]
An object-oriented module is composed of two files. The definitions file is called the
header file
. Here is a C++
header file
for the
GRADE class
in a simple school application:
// grade.h
// -------
// Used to allow multiple source files to include
// this header file without duplication errors.
// ----------------------------------------------
#ifndef GRADE_H
#define GRADE_H
class
GRADE
{
public
:
// This is the constructor operation.
// ----------------------------------
GRADE
(
const
char
letter
);
// This is a class variable.
// -------------------------
char
letter
;
// This is a member operation.
// ---------------------------
int
grade_numeric
(
const
char
letter
);
// This is a class variable.
// -------------------------
int
numeric
;
};
#endif
A
constructor
operation is a function with the same name as the class name.
[72]
It is executed when the calling operation executes the
new
statement.
A module's other file is the
source file
. Here is a C++ source file for the
GRADE class
in a simple school application:
// grade.cpp
// ---------
#include
"grade.h"

Declarative languages
[
edit
]
Main article:
Declarative programming
Imperative languages
have one major criticism: assigning an expression to a
non-local
variable may produce an unintended
side effect
.
[73]
Declarative languages
generally omit the assignment statement and the control flow. They describe
what
computation should be performed and not
how
to compute it. Two broad categories of declarative languages are
functional languages
and
logical languages
.
The principle behind a
functional language
is to use
lambda calculus
as a guide for a well defined
semantic
.
[74]
In mathematics, a function is a rule that maps elements from an
expression
to a range of
values
. Consider the function:
times_10(x) = 10 * x
The
expression
10 * x
is mapped by the function
times_10()
to a range of
values
. One
value
happens to be 20. This occurs when x is 2. So, the application of the function is mathematically written as:
times_10(2) = 20
A
functional language
compiler will not store this value in a variable. Instead, it will
push
the value onto the computer's
stack
before setting the
program counter
back to the calling function. The calling function will then
pop
the value from the stack.
[75]
Imperative languages
do support functions. Therefore,
functional programming
can be achieved in an imperative language, if the programmer uses discipline. However, a
functional language
will force this discipline onto the programmer through its syntax. Functional languages have a syntax tailored to emphasize the
what
.
[76]
A functional program is developed with a set of primitive functions followed by a single driver function.
[73]
Consider the
snippet
:
function max(a,b){/* code omitted */}
function min(a,b){/* code omitted */}
function difference_between_largest_and_smallest(a,b,c) {
return max(a,max(b,c)) - min(a, min(b,c));
}
The primitives are
max()
and
min()
. The driver function is
difference_between_largest_and_smallest()
. Executing:
put(difference_between_largest_and_smallest(10,4,7));
will output 6.
Functional languages
are used in
computer science
research to explore new language features.
[77]
Moreover, their lack of side-effects have made them popular in
parallel programming
and
concurrent programming
.
[78]
However, application developers prefer the
object-oriented features
of
imperative languages
.
[78]
Lisp
[
edit
]
Lisp
(1958) stands for "LISt Processor."
[79]
It is tailored to process
lists
. A full structure of the data is formed by building lists of lists. In memory, a
tree data structure
is built. Internally, the tree structure lends nicely for
recursive
functions.
[80]
The syntax to build a tree is to enclose the space-separated
elements
within parenthesis. The following is a
list
of three elements. The first two elements are themselves lists of two elements:
((A B) (HELLO WORLD) 94)
Lisp has functions to extract and reconstruct elements.
[81]
The function
head()
returns a list containing the first element in the list. The function
tail()
returns a list containing everything but the first element. The function
cons()
returns a list that is the concatenation of other lists. Therefore, the following expression will return the list
x
:
cons(head(x), tail(x))
One drawback of Lisp is when many functions are nested, the parentheses may look confusing.
[76]
Modern Lisp
environments
help ensure parenthesis match. As an aside, Lisp does support the
imperative language
operations of the assignment statement and goto loops.
[82]
Also,
Lisp
is not concerned with the
datatype
of the elements at compile time.
[83]
Instead, it assigns (and may reassign) the datatypes at
runtime
. Assigning the datatype at runtime is called
dynamic binding
.
[84]
Whereas dynamic binding increases the language's flexibility, programming errors may linger until late in the
software development process
.
[84]
Writing large, reliable, and readable Lisp programs requires forethought. If properly planned, the program may be much shorter than an equivalent
imperative language
program.
[76]
Lisp
is widely used in
artificial intelligence
. However, its usage has been accepted only because it has
imperative language
operations, making unintended side-effects possible.
[78]
ML
[
edit
]
ML
(1973)
[85]
stands for "Meta Language." ML checks to make sure only data of the same type are compared with one another.
[86]
For example, this function has one input parameter (an integer) and returns an integer:
fun
times_10
(
n
:
int
)
:
int
=
10
*
n
;
ML
is not parenthesis-eccentric like
Lisp
. The following is an application of
times_10()
:
times_10 2
It returns "20 : int". (Both the results and the datatype are returned.)
Like
Lisp
,
ML
is tailored to process lists. Unlike
Lisp
, each element is the same datatype.
[87]
Moreover,
ML
assigns the datatype of an element at
compile-time
. Assigning the datatype at compile-time is called
static binding
. Static binding increases reliability because the compiler checks the context of variables before they are used.
[88]
Prolog
[
edit
]
Prolog
(1972) stands for "PROgramming in LOGic." It is a
logic programming
language, based on formal
logic
. The language was developed by
Alain Colmerauer
and Philippe Roussel in Marseille, France. It is an implementation of
Selective Linear Definite clause resolution
, pioneered by
Robert Kowalski
and others at the
University of Edinburgh
.
[89]
The building blocks of a Prolog program are
facts
and
rules
. Here is a simple example:
cat
(
tom
).
% tom is a cat
mouse
(
jerry
).
% jerry is a mouse
animal
(
X
)
:-
cat
(
X
).
% each cat is an animal
animal
(
X
)
:-
mouse
(
X
).
% each mouse is an animal
big
(
X
)
:-
cat
(
X
).
% each cat is big
small
(
X
)
:-
mouse
(
X
).
% each mouse is small
eat
(
X
,
Y
)
:-
mouse
(
X
),
cheese
(
Y
).
% each mouse eats each cheese
eat
(
X
,
Y
)
:-
big
(
X
),
small
(
Y
).
% each big animal eats each small animal
After all the facts and rules are entered, then a question can be asked:
Will Tom eat Jerry?
?-
eat
(
tom
,
jerry
).
true
The following example shows how Prolog will convert a letter grade to its numeric value:
numeric_grade
(
'A'
,
4
).
numeric_grade
(
'B'
,
3
).
numeric_grade
(
'C'
,
2
).
numeric_grade
(
'D'
,
1
).
numeric_grade
(
'F'
,
0
).
numeric_grade
(
X
,
-
1
)
:-
not
X
=
'A'
,
not
X
=
'B'
,
not
X
=
'C'
,
not
X
=
'D'
,
not
X
=
'F'
.
grade
(
'The Student'
,
'A'
).
?-
grade
(
'The Student'
,
X
),
numeric_grade
(
X
,
Y
).
X
=
'A'
,
Y
=
4
Here is a comprehensive example:
[90]
1) All dragons billow fire, or equivalently, a thing billows fire if the thing is a dragon:
billows_fire
(
X
)
:-
is_a_dragon
(
X
).
2) A creature billows fire if one of its parents billows fire:
billows_fire
(
X
)
:-
is_a_creature
(
X
),
is_a_parent_of
(
Y
,
X
),
billows_fire
(
Y
).
3) A thing X is a parent of a thing Y if X is the mother of Y or X is the father of Y:
is_a_parent_of
(
X
,
Y
):-
is_the_mother_of
(
X
,
Y
).
is_a_parent_of
(
X
,
Y
):-
is_the_father_of
(
X
,
Y
).
4) A thing is a creature if the thing is a dragon:
is_a_creature
(
X
)
:-
is_a_dragon
(
X
).
5) Norberta is a dragon, and Puff is a creature. Norberta is the mother of Puff.
is_a_dragon
(
norberta
).
is_a_creature
(
puff
).
is_the_mother_of
(
norberta
,
puff
).
Rule (2) is a
recursive
(inductive) definition. It can be understood declaratively, without the need to understand how it is executed.
Rule (3) shows how
functions
are represented by using relations. Here, the mother and father functions ensure that every individual has only one mother and only one father.
Prolog is an untyped language. Nonetheless,
inheritance
can be represented by using predicates. Rule (4) asserts that a creature is a superclass of a dragon.
Questions are answered using
backward reasoning
. Given the question:
?-
billows_fire
(
X
).
Prolog generates two answers :
X
=
norberta
X
=
puff
Practical applications for Prolog are
knowledge representation
and
problem solving
in
artificial intelligence
.
Object-oriented programming
[
edit
]
Object-oriented programming
is a programming method to execute
operations
(
functions
) on
objects
.
[91]
The basic idea is to group the characteristics of a
phenomenon
into an object
container
and give the container a name. The
operations
on the phenomenon are also grouped into the container.
[91]
Object-oriented programming
developed by combining the need for containers and the need for safe
functional programming
.
[92]
This programming method need not be confined to an
object-oriented language
.
[93]
In an object-oriented language, an object container is called a
class
. In a non-object-oriented language, a
data structure
(which is also known as a
record
) may become an object container. To turn a data structure into an object container, operations need to be written specifically for the structure. The resulting structure is called an
abstract datatype
.
[94]
However,
inheritance
will be missing. Nonetheless, this shortcoming can be overcome.
Here is a
C programming language
header file
for the
GRADE abstract datatype
in a simple school application:
/* grade.h */
/* ------- */
/* Used to allow multiple source files to include */
/* this header file without duplication errors.   */
/* ---------------------------------------------- */
#ifndef GRADE_H
#define GRADE_H
typedef
struct

GRADE
;
/* Constructor */
/* ----------- */
GRADE
*
grade_new
(
char
letter
);
int
grade_numeric
(
char
letter
);
#endif
The
grade_new()
function performs the same algorithm as the C++
constructor
operation.

In the constructor, the function

is used instead of

The formal strategy to build object-oriented objects is to:
[95]
Identify the objects. Most likely these will be nouns.
Identify each object's attributes. What helps to describe the object?
Identify each object's actions. Most likely these will be verbs.
Identify the relationships from object to object. Most likely these will be verbs.
For example:
A person is a human identified by a name.
A grade is an achievement identified by a letter.
A student is a person who earns a grade.
Syntax and semantics
[
edit
]
The
syntax
of a programming language is a
list
of
production rules
which govern its
form
.
[96]
A programming language's
form
is the correct placement of its
declarations
,
expressions
, and
statements
.
[97]
Complementing the syntax of a language are its
semantics
. The
semantics
describe the meanings attached to various syntactic constructs.
[96]
A syntactic construct may need a semantic description because a form may have an invalid interpretation.
[98]
Also, different languages might have the same syntax; however, their behaviors may be different.
The syntax of a language is formally described by listing the
production rules
. Whereas the syntax of a
natural language
is extremely complicated, a subset of the English language can have this production rule listing:
[99]
a
sentence
is made up of a
noun-phrase
followed by a
verb-phrase
;
a
noun-phrase
is made up of an
article
followed by an
adjective
followed by a
noun
;
a
verb-phrase
is made up of a
verb
followed by a
noun-phrase
;
an
article
is 'the';
an
adjective
is 'big' or
an
adjective
is 'small';
a
noun
is 'cat' or
a
noun
is 'mouse';
a
verb
is 'eats';
The words in
bold-face
are known as "non-terminals". The words in 'single quotes' are known as "terminals".
[100]
From this production rule listing, complete sentences may be formed using a series of replacements.
[101]
The process is to replace
non-terminals
with either a valid
non-terminal
or a valid
terminal
. The replacement process repeats until only
terminals
remain. One valid sentence is:
sentence
noun-phrase
verb-phrase
article
adjective
noun
verb-phrase
the
adjective
noun
verb-phrase
the
big
noun
verb-phrase
the
big
cat
verb-phrase
the
big
cat
verb
noun-phrase
the
big
cat
eats
noun-phrase
the
big
cat
eats
article
adjective
noun
the
big
cat
eats
the
adjective
noun
the
big
cat
eats
the
small
noun
the
big
cat
eats
the
small
mouse
However, another combination results in an invalid sentence:
the
small
mouse
eats
the
big
cat
Therefore, a
semantic
is necessary to correctly describe the meaning of an
eat
activity.
One
production rule
listing method is called the
Backus-Naur form
(BNF).
[102]
BNF describes the syntax of a language and itself has a
syntax
. This recursive definition is an example of a
meta-language
.
[96]
The
syntax
of BNF includes:
::=
which translates to
is made up of a[n]
when a non-terminal is to its right. It translates to
is
when a terminal is to its right.
|
which translates to
or
.
<
and
>
which surround
non-terminals
.
Using BNF, a subset of the English language can have this
production rule
listing:
<
sentence
>
::=
<
noun-phrase
><
verb-phrase
>
<
noun-phrase
>
::=
<
article
><
adjective
><
noun
>
<
verb-phrase
>
::=
<
verb
><
noun-phrase
>
<
article
>
::=
the
<
adjective
>
::=
big | small
<
noun
>
::=
cat | mouse
<
verb
>
::=
eats
Using BNF, a signed-
integer
has the
production rule
listing:
[103]
<
signed-integer
>
::=
<
sign
><
integer
>
<
sign
>
::=
+ | -
<
integer
>
::=
<
digit
>
|
<
digit
><
integer
>
<
digit
>
::=
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
Notice the recursive production rule:
<
integer
>
::=
<
digit
>
|
<
digit
><
integer
>
This allows for an infinite number of possibilities. Therefore, a
semantic
is necessary to describe a limitation of the number of digits.
Notice the leading zero possibility in the production rules:
<
integer
>
::=
<
digit
>
|
<
digit
><
integer
>
<
digit
>
::=
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
Therefore, a
semantic
is necessary to describe that leading zeros need to be ignored.
Two formal methods are available to describe
semantics
. They are
denotational semantics
and
axiomatic semantics
.

Software engineering and computer programming
[
edit
]
Prior to programming languages,
Betty Jennings
and
Fran Bilas
programmed the
ENIAC
by moving cables and setting switches.
Software engineering
is a variety of techniques to produce quality software.
[105]
Computer programming
is the process of writing or editing
source code
. In a formal environment, a
systems analyst
will gather information from managers about all the organization's processes to automate. This professional then prepares a
detailed plan
for the new or modified system.
[106]
The plan is analogous to an architect's blueprint.
[106]
Performance objectives
[
edit
]
The systems analyst has the objective to deliver the right information to the right person at the right time.
[107]
The critical factors to achieve this objective are:
[107]
The quality of the output. Is the output useful for decision-making?
The accuracy of the output. Does it reflect the true situation?
The format of the output. Is the output easily understood?
The speed of the output. Time-sensitive information is important when communicating with the customer in real time.
Cost objectives
[
edit
]
Achieving performance objectives should be balanced with all of the costs, including:
[108]
Development costs.
Uniqueness costs. A reusable system may be expensive. However, it might be preferred over a limited-use system.
Hardware costs.
Operating costs.
Applying a
systems development process
will mitigate the axiom: the later in the process an error is detected, the more expensive it is to correct.
[109]
Waterfall model
[
edit
]
The
waterfall model
is an implementation of a
systems development process
.
[110]
As the
waterfall
label implies, the basic phases overlap each other:
[111]
The
investigation phase
is to understand the underlying problem.
The
analysis phase
is to understand the possible solutions.
The
design phase
is to plan the best solution.
The
implementation phase
is to program the best solution.
The
maintenance phase
lasts throughout the life of the system. Changes to the system after it is deployed may be necessary.
[112]
Faults may exist, including specification faults, design faults, or coding faults. Improvements may be necessary. Adaption may be necessary to react to a changing environment.
Computer programmer
[
edit
]
A
computer programmer
is a specialist responsible for writing or modifying the source code to implement the detailed plan.
[106]
A programming team is likely to be needed because most systems are too large to be completed by a single programmer.
[113]
However, adding programmers to a project may not shorten the completion time. Instead, it may lower the quality of the system.
[113]
To be effective, program modules need to be defined and distributed to team members.
[113]
Also, team members must interact with one another in a meaningful and effective way.
[113]
Computer programmers may be
programming in the small
: programming within a single module.
[114]
Chances are a module will execute modules located in other source code files. Therefore, computer programmers may be
programming in the large
: programming modules so they will effectively couple with each other.
[114]
Programming-in-the-large includes contributing to the
application programming interface
(API).
Program modules
[
edit
]
Modular programming
is a technique to refine
imperative language
programs. Refined programs may reduce the software size, separate responsibilities, and thereby mitigate
software aging
. A
program module
is a sequence of statements that are bounded within a
block
and together identified by a name.
[115]
Modules have a
function
,
context
, and
logic
:
[116]
The
function
of a module is what it does.
The
context
of a module are the elements being performed upon.
The
logic
of a module is how it performs the function.
The module's name should be derived first by its
function
, then by its
context
. Its
logic
should not be part of the name.
[116]
For example,
function compute_square_root( x )
or
function compute_square_root_integer( i : integer )
are appropriate module names. However,
function compute_square_root_by_division( x )
is not.
The degree of interaction
within
a module is its level of
cohesion
.
[116]
Cohesion
is a judgment of the relationship between a module's name and its
function
. The degree of interaction
between
modules is the level of
coupling
.
[117]
Coupling
is a judgement of the relationship between a module's
context
and the elements being performed upon.
Cohesion
[
edit
]
The levels of cohesion from worst to best are:
[118]
Coincidental Cohesion
: A module has coincidental cohesion if it performs multiple functions, and the functions are completely unrelated. For example,
function read_sales_record_print_next_line_convert_to_float()
. Coincidental cohesion occurs in practice if management enforces silly rules. For example, "Every module will have between 35 and 50 executable statements."
[118]
Logical Cohesion: A module has logical cohesion if it has available a series of functions, but only one of them is executed. For example,
function perform_arithmetic( perform_addition, a, b )
.
Temporal Cohesion
: A module has temporal cohesion if it performs functions related to time. One example,
function initialize_variables_and_open_files()
. Another example,
stage_one()
,
stage_two()
, ...
Procedural Cohesion
: A module has procedural cohesion if it performs multiple loosely related functions. For example,
function read_part_number_update_employee_record()
.
Communicational Cohesion
: A module has communicational cohesion if it performs multiple closely related functions. For example,
function read_part_number_update_sales_record()
.
Informational Cohesion
: A module has informational cohesion if it performs multiple functions, but each function has its own entry and exit points. Moreover, the functions share the same data structure. Object-oriented classes work at this level.
Functional Cohesion
: a module has functional cohesion if it achieves a single goal working only on local variables. Moreover, it may be reusable in other contexts.
Coupling
[
edit
]
The levels of coupling from worst to best are:
[117]
Content Coupling
: A module has content coupling if it modifies a local variable of another function. COBOL used to do this with the
alter
verb.
Common Coupling
: A module has common coupling if it modifies a global variable.
Control Coupling
: A module has control coupling if another module can modify its
control flow
. For example,
perform_arithmetic( perform_addition, a, b )
. Instead, control should be on the makeup of the returned object.
Stamp Coupling
: A module has stamp coupling if an element of a data structure passed as a parameter is modified. Object-oriented classes work at this level.
Data Coupling
: A module has data coupling if all of its input parameters are needed and none of them are modified. Moreover, the result of the function is returned as a single object.
Data flow analysis
[
edit
]
A sample function-level data-flow diagram
Data flow analysis
is a design method used to achieve modules of
functional cohesion
and
data coupling
.
[119]
The input to the method is a
data-flow diagram
. A data-flow diagram is a set of ovals representing modules. Each module's name is displayed inside its oval. Modules may be at the executable level or the function level.
The diagram also has arrows connecting modules to each other. Arrows pointing into modules represent a set of inputs. Each module should have only one arrow pointing out from it to represent its single output object. (Optionally, an additional exception arrow points out.) A
daisy chain
of ovals will convey an entire
algorithm
. The input modules should start the diagram. The input modules should connect to the transform modules. The transform modules should connect to the output modules.
[120]
Functional categories
[
edit
]
A diagram showing that the
user
interacts with the
application software
. The application software interacts with the
operating system
, which interacts with the
hardware
.
Computer programs
may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are
application software
and
system software
. System software includes the
operating system
, which couples
computer hardware
with application software.
[121]
The purpose of the operating system is to provide an environment where application software executes in a convenient and efficient manner.
[121]
Both application software and system software execute
utility programs
. At the hardware level, a
microcode program
controls the circuits throughout the
central processing unit
.
Application software
[
edit
]
Main article:
Application software
Application software is the key to unlocking the potential of the computer system.
[122]
Enterprise application software
bundles accounting, personnel, customer, and vendor applications. Examples include
enterprise resource planning
,
customer relationship management
, and
supply chain management software
.
Enterprise applications may be developed in-house as a one-of-a-kind
proprietary software
.
[123]
Alternatively, they may be purchased as
off-the-shelf software
. Purchased software may be modified to provide
custom software
. If the application is customized, then either the company's resources are used or the resources are outsourced. Outsourced software development may be from the original software vendor or a third-party developer.
[124]
The potential advantages of in-house software are features and reports may be developed exactly to specification.
[125]
Management may also be involved in the development process and offer a level of control.
[126]
Management may decide to counteract a competitor's new initiative or implement a customer or vendor requirement.
[127]
A merger or acquisition may necessitate enterprise software changes. The potential disadvantages of in-house software are time and resource costs may be extensive.
[123]
Furthermore, risks concerning features and performance may be looming.
The potential advantages of off-the-shelf software are upfront costs are identifiable, the basic needs should be fulfilled, and its performance and reliability have a track record.
[123]
The potential disadvantages of off-the-shelf software are it may have unnecessary features that confuse end users, it may lack features the enterprise needs, and the data flow may not match the enterprise's work processes.
[123]
One approach to economically obtaining a customized enterprise application is through an
application service provider
.
[128]
Specialty companies provide hardware, custom software, and end-user support. They may speed the development of new applications because they possess skilled information system staff. The biggest advantage is it frees in-house resources from staffing and managing complex computer projects.
[128]
Many application service providers target small, fast-growing companies with limited information system resources.
[128]
On the other hand, larger companies with major systems will likely have their technical infrastructure in place. One risk is having to trust an external organization with sensitive information. Another risk is having to trust the provider's infrastructure reliability.
[128]
Operating system

An
operating system
is the low-level software that supports a computer's basic functions, such as
scheduling
processes
and controlling
peripherals
.
[121]
In the 1950s, the programmer, who was also the operator, would write a program and run it. After the program finished executing, the output may have been printed, or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing.
[28]
More often than not the program did not work. The programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches. If less fortunate, a memory printout was made for further study. In the 1960s, programmers reduced the amount of wasted time by automating the operator's job. A program called an
operating system
was kept in the computer at all times.
[129]
The term
operating system
may refer to two levels of software.
[130]
The operating system may refer to the
kernel program
that manages the
processes
,
memory
, and
devices
. More broadly, the operating system may refer to the entire package of the central software. The package includes a kernel program,
command-line interpreter
,
graphical user interface
,
utility programs
, and
editor
.
[130]
Kernel Program
[
edit
]
A kernel connects the application software to the hardware of a computer.
The kernel's main purpose is to manage the limited resources of a computer:
The kernel program should perform
process scheduling
.
[131]
The kernel creates a
process control block
when a program is
selected for execution
. However, an executing program gets exclusive access to the
central processing unit
only for a
time slice
. To provide each user with the
appearance of continuous access
, the kernel quickly
preempts
each process control block to execute another one. The goal for
system developers
is to minimize
dispatch latency
.
Physical memory is scattered around RAM and the hard disk. Virtual memory is one continuous block.
The kernel program should perform
memory management
.
When the kernel initially
loads
an executable into memory, it divides the address space logically into
regions
.
[132]
The kernel maintains a master-region table and many per-process-region (pregion) tables—one for each running
process
.
[132]
These tables constitute the
virtual address space
. The master-region table is used to determine where its contents are located in
physical memory
. The pregion tables allow each process to have its own program (text) pregion, data pregion, and stack pregion.
The program pregion stores machine instructions. Since machine instructions do not change, the program pregion may be shared by many processes of the same executable.
[132]
To save time and memory, the kernel may load only blocks of execution instructions from the disk drive, not the entire execution file completely.
[131]
The kernel is responsible for translating virtual addresses into
physical addresses
. The kernel may request data from the
memory controller
and, instead, receive a
page fault
.
[133]
If so, the kernel accesses the
memory management unit
to populate the physical data region and translate the address.
[134]
The kernel allocates memory from the
heap
upon request by a process.
[64]
When the process is finished with the memory, the process may request for it to be
freed
. If the process exits without requesting all allocated memory to be freed, then the kernel performs
garbage collection
to free the memory.
The kernel also ensures that a process only accesses its own memory, and not that of the kernel or other processes.
[131]
The kernel program should perform
file system management
.
[131]
The kernel has instructions to create, retrieve, update, and delete files.
The kernel program should perform
device management
.
[131]
The kernel provides programs to standardize and simplify the interface to the mouse, keyboard, disk drives, printers, and other devices. Moreover, the kernel should arbitrate access to a device if two processes request it at the same time.
The kernel program should perform
network management
.
[135]
The kernel transmits and receives
packets
on behalf of processes. One key service is to find an efficient
route
to the target system.
The kernel program should provide
system level functions
for programmers to use.
[136]
Programmers access files through a relatively simple interface that in turn executes a relatively complicated low-level I/O interface. The low-level interface includes file creation,
file descriptors
, file seeking, physical reading, and physical writing.
Programmers create processes through a relatively simple interface that in turn executes a relatively complicated low-level interface.
Programmers perform date/time arithmetic through a relatively simple interface that in turn executes a relatively complicated low-level time interface.
[137]
The kernel program should provide a
communication channel
between executing processes.
[138]
For a large software system, it may be desirable to
engineer
the system into smaller processes. Processes may communicate with one another by sending and receiving
signals
.
Originally, operating systems were programmed in
assembly
; however, modern operating systems are typically written in higher-level languages like
C
,
Objective-C
, and
Swift
.

Utility program
[
edit
]
A
utility program
is designed to aid system administration and software execution. Operating systems execute hardware utility programs to check the status of disk drives, memory, speakers, and printers.
[139]
A utility program may optimize the placement of a file on a crowded disk. System utility programs monitor hardware and network performance. When a metric is outside an acceptable range, a trigger alert is generated.
[140]
Utility programs include compression programs so data files are stored on less disk space.
[139]
Compressed programs also save time when data files are transmitted over the network.
[139]
Utility programs can sort and merge data sets.
[140]
Utility programs detect
computer viruses
.
[140]
Microcode program
[
edit
]
Main article:
Microcode
NOT gate
NAND gate
NOR gate
AND gate
OR gate
A
microcode program
is the bottom-level interpreter that controls the
data path
of software-driven computers.
[141]
(Advances in
hardware
have migrated these operations to
hardware execution circuits
.)
[141]
Microcode instructions allow the programmer to more easily implement the
digital logic level
[142]
—the computer's real hardware. The digital logic level is the boundary between
computer science
and
computer engineering
.
[143]
A
logic gate
is a tiny
transistor
that can return one of two signals: on or off.
[144]
Having one transistor forms the
NOT gate
.
Connecting two transistors in series forms the
NAND gate
.
Connecting two transistors in parallel forms the
NOR gate
.
Connecting a NOT gate to a NAND gate forms the
AND gate
.
Connecting a NOT gate to a NOR gate forms the
OR gate
.
These five gates form the building blocks of
binary algebra
—the digital logic functions of the computer.
Microcode instructions are
mnemonics
programmers may use to execute digital logic functions instead of forming them in binary algebra. They are stored in a
central processing unit's
(CPU)
control store
.
[145]
These hardware-level instructions move data throughout the
data path
.
The micro-instruction cycle begins when the
microsequencer
uses its microprogram counter to
fetch
the next
machine instruction
from
random-access memory

[146]
The next step is to
decode
the machine instruction by selecting the proper output line to the hardware module.
[147]
The final step is to
execute
the instruction using the hardware module's set of gates.
A symbolic representation of an ALU
Instructions to perform arithmetic are passed through an
arithmetic logic unit
(ALU).
[148]
The ALU has circuits to perform elementary operations to add, shift, and compare integers. By combining and looping the elementary operations through the ALU, the CPU performs its complex arithmetic.
Microcode instructions move data between the CPU and the
memory controller
. Memory controller microcode instructions manipulate two
registers
. The
memory address register
is used to access each memory cell's address. The
memory data register
is used to set and read each cell's contents.
[149]
Microcode instructions move data between the CPU and the many
computer buses
. The
disk controller bus
writes to and reads from
hard disk drives
. Data is also moved between the CPU and other functional units via the
peripheral component interconnect express bus.

plus several European sides
The
1925 European tour
was a highlight in the
history of Boca Juniors
where the club toured Europe to play a series of friendly matches from March 5 to June 7, 1925, becoming the first Argentine team to play there.
[1]
[2]
Boca Juniors
played a total of 19 matches, 13 in
Spain
, 5 in
Germany
, and 1 in
France
, winning 15, with 3 losses and 1 draw. The squad scored 40 goals and conceded 16, with a win percentage of 78.95%.
[3]
The delegation included executive representatives such as vice president Adelio Cariboni and secretary Vicente Decap. The roster was
Américo Tesoriere
,
Ludovico Bidoglio
,
Ramón Muttis
, Segundo Médici, Alfredo Elli, Mario Busso,
Domingo Tarasconi
, Antonio Cerrotti, Dante Pertini, Carmelo Pozzo, Carlos Antraygues and
Alfredo Garasini
. Some players from other clubes were also added to the team specially for the tour, they were
Manuel Seoane
(
El Porvenir
),
Cesáreo Onzari
(
Huracán
), Luis Vaccaro (
Argentinos Juniors
),
Octavio Díaz
(
Rosario Central
) and Roberto Cochrane (
Tiro Federal
). Tarasconi and Elli were designed as managers.
[2]
Manuel Seoane was the topscorer of the tour, with 12 goals in 16 games played. Because of the successful result, the
Argentine Football Association
(AFA) crowned Boca Juniors as "Champion of Honor".
[4]
Background
[
edit
]
Pozzo, Vaccaro and Medice holding a Boca Juniors flag, a gift from Jockey Club of Buenos Aires.
Inspired on the recognition gained by the
Uruguay national team
in the
1924 Olympic Games
after the squad won the tournament, the Argentine Association planned to send the Argentina national team to tour on Europe. Nevertheless, the project was not carried out so the Boca Juniors executives offered to send club's team to replace the Argentine side. The request was accepted by the AFA and Boca followed in the footsteps of Uruguayan team
Nacional
, that had toured Europe few months before.
[5]
[6]
The tour was organised by three representative of Spanish immigrants in Argentina, Zapater, Isasmendi and Ibáñez, becoming the first entrepreneurs in Argentine football. It is also believed that the original idea of a tour came from Natalio Botana, director of
Crítica
, the main newspaper by then.
[7]
The club had to paid
A$
10 per each player as expenses.
[8]
Finally, on February 4, 1925, the team departed to Europe boarding the
De la Carrera
vessel, with a large number of fans (about 10,000)
[7]
saying goodbye to the players at the port. In
Montevideo
the delegation transhipped to a
steamboat
, the
Formosa
, which took 22 days to arrive in
Vigo
,
Spain
.
"Never before it had been seen so many people like the large amount of fans that attended the port of Buenos Aires to say goodbye to a sports delegation (...) Hats and handkerchiefs were thrown to the air as a sign of farewell"
—
La Nación
, 1925
[3]
The delegation was accompanied by a Boca Juniors fan named Victoriano Caffarena, who not only financed part of the tour, but helped the players as an occasional
masseur
and
kit manager
. Caffarana was recognised as
the n° 12 player
(the nickname was given by Tesoriere and Cerrotti),
[9]
a denomination that would be later applied to every Boca Juniors supporters.

Team that played the first match of the tour v.
Celta de Vigo
on March 5, 1925.

Real Madrid
.
The first match of the tourn was on March 5, 1925, v.
Celta de Vigo
with an attendance of 25,000 spectators. Antonio Cerrotti opened the score with only 2' played, becoming the first Argentine footballer to score a goal in Europe.
[12]
During that match, the roof of a near factory collapsed under the weight of several workers that were watching the match. Therefore, the game was suspended for 16 minutes.
[13]
Boca Juniors won the match by 3-1. Three days after a second game between Boca and Celta was played, and the local team won by the same score.
After the matches v. Celta, Boca Juniors moved to
La Coruña
to play two games v. the local team,
Deportivo de La Coruña
, on March 12 and 15 respectively. Boca Juniors won the first game by 3-0 and Tesoriere became the first Argentine goalkeeper to make a save from a
penalty kick
. Boca also won the second test v. La Coruña by 1-0. After those victories Boca travelled to
Madrid
where the squad defeated
Atlético de Madrid
by 2-1 and three days later beat
Real Madrid
by 1-0.
[14]
King Alfonso XIII
and his son
Alfonso, Prince of Asturias
were among the spectators at the match. With 10' of the match played, the referee stopped the game to allow players to salute them.
The last match played by Boca Juniors in the city was against
Sociedad Gimnástica Española
, where Vaccaro was injured, missing the rest of the tour games.
After the games in Madrid, Boca Juniors moved to
Bilbao
, where the team was beat by
Real Unión de Irún
by 4-0 and then
Athletic Bilbao
by 4-2. In the game v. Athletic, the players abandoned the field as a protest for a penalty kick conceded to the local team. Nevertheless, the squad returned shortly after and the game was completed.
The tour on Spain continued in
Pamplona
where Boca Juniors defeated
Osasuna
by 1-0, finishing in
Barcelona
where Boca defeated
RCD Espanyol
twice (1-0 and 3-0) and a
Catalonia
combined by 2-0.
Germany and France
[
edit
]
One of Boca Juniors line-ups during the European tour
Boca had planned to continue the tour on France after the last game in Spain. However, the two consecutive losses to Real Unión and Athletic Bilbao made the French organisers to turn back their decision. As a result, the team went to
Munich
,
Germany
.
[3]
[15]
In that city Boca played
Bayern Munich
on May 9, then moving to
Berlin
where Boca Juniors beat Nord West. Some days later, in
Leipzig
, Boca achieved its largest victory of the tour when the squad thrashed
SpVgg Leipzig
7-0.
Finally, the team finished the tour in
Frankfurt
where it played two games else. The good results in Germany made the French organisers reconsidered to play a friendly match between a French team and Boca Juniors. Therefore, the team extended the tour playing one game else, when in
Paris
Boca Juniors defeated a local combined by 4-2 with three goals by
Manuel Seoane
.

Notes
Return to Argentina
[
edit
]
The team arrived in Buenos Aires on July 12, 1925, after a trip that took over a month. The squad was awaited by a crowd of people that received them as heroes.
[17]
The Argentine Association crowned Boca Juniors as "Champion of Honor", an honorary title (unofficial) in recognition to the great campaign during the tour. Boca Juniors did not participate in the
1925 championship
that was won by
Huracán
.
After the players came back to their clubs, Boca returned to the official competition in
1926
, when the squad won the Primera División championship remaining unbeaten at the end of the tournament. Boca won 15 matches over 17 played.
[18]
Financial cost
[
edit
]
Despite being successful in terms of sports results, the tour caused a large deficit in Boca Juniors' finances and was followed by a huge controversy that forced Manlio Anastasi to resign as president of the club. Nevertheless, most of blame was on club executive and businessman Félix Isasmendi. He was accused of bad negotiation so Boca Juniors earned low payments from the European clubs, apart from not taking  percentage of ticket selling.
[1]
The European clubs are business rather than sports clubs, which being assured that matches would collect the double, triple, or quadruple than usual, offered ridicule payments instead.
—
Boca Juniors executive Héctor Manni about the tour
Summarizing, Boca Juniors was paid near
MN$
60,000. On the other hand, costs were MN$54,000 for boat tickets and player salaries plus NN$32,000 for accommodation and trip expenses.
[1]
Social impact
[
edit
]
The huge success achieved by Boca Juniors brought immediate consequences for the club. The team was acclaimed by both, media and fans, gaining  recognition and popularity. Before the tour, Boca Juniors was a club that represented a neighborhood (
La Boca
), being considered a local team. As a result of the great campaign in Europe, Boca Juniors became a national institution, with fans through the country.

Verse 1
[
edit
]
See also:
Matthew 12:1
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
[1]
German
Protestant theologian
Heinrich Meyer
notes that there was no accusation of
trespass
or
theft
here: "any one was allowed to pluck ... ears of corn in another man’s field till he was satisfied" in accordance with
:
If you go into your neighbour’s standing grain, you may pluck the ears with your hand, but you shall not put a
sickle
to your neighbour’s standing grain
.
The
Mosaic law
left it unclear whether such licence was authorised on the Sabbath. Both Mark and Luke raise the controversy about the sabbath earlier in their respective gospels (
and
).
[2]
Fulfillment of the Servant Song of Isaiah
[
edit
]
Matthew states that Jesus' withdrawal from the cities of Galilee and his request that the crowds not make him known
[3]
is a fulfillment of the first
Servant Song
of the prophet
Isaiah
. The verses quoted from
Isaiah
are from the
Septuagint
version of
.
[4]
One difference from the
Hebrew
version is found in verse 21 (Isaiah 42:4).
In translation from the Hebrew version, this reads:
and the coastlands shall wait for His law
In the Septuagint and in Matthew's Gospel this reads:
and in his name shall the Gentiles trust
.
Verses 17-21
[
edit
]
17
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
18
"Behold! My Servant whom I have chosen,
My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased!
I will put My Spirit upon Him,
And He will declare justice to the Gentiles.
19
He will not quarrel nor cry out,
Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
20
A bruised reed He will not break,
And smoking flax He will not quench,
Till He sends forth justice to victory;
21
And in His name Gentiles will trust."
[5]
Careless or idle words
[
edit
]
Dale Allison
associates the references to "idle" words in verses 36 and 37 with the earlier references to
blasphemy
in
verse 31
, and sees Jesus as refuting the suggestion that blasphemy "cannot really have eternal consequence because it consists of nothing but words".
[6]
Verse 36
[
edit
]
But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
[7]
Theologian
Albert Barnes
describes an "idle word" as literally "a vain, thoughtless, useless word; a word that accomplishes no good", but states that in the context the meaning is "wicked, injurious, false [or] malicious" words.
[8]
The Greek reveals a contrast between ρημα αργον,
rhēma argon

Frank Weston Sandford
(October 2, 1862 - March 4, 1948)
[1]
was a
charismatic
Christian
religious leader in the United States who attained notoriety as the founder and leader of an
apocalyptic
sect known as "The Kingdom".
Born in
Bowdoinham
,
Maine
, to a farming family, Sandford was exposed to concepts such as
premillennialism
, the
Higher Life movement
, the indwelling power of the
Holy Spirit
, and
divine healing
in his thirties. In August 1891, after performing an
exorcism
and claiming to hear the voice of
God
warn him of "
Armageddon
", he established a
commune
called
the "Shiloh"
in
Durham, Maine
. Commune members were forced to
fast
, pray for hours-on-end and obey Sandford's orders absolutely. After commune members disagreed about his
biblical interpretations
, he instituted a chain-of-command in which his orders were limited by only by those of God and
Jesus Christ
. Eventually he declared himself the
incarnation
of the prophet
Elijah
and
King David
, and established The Kingdom.
Considered by former members and many of his neighbors to be an
autocrat
who insisted on unquestioning loyalty, Sandford regularly starved his followers, which resulted in deadly outbreaks of
smallpox
,
diphtheria
, and other infectious diseases. The death of 14-year-old Leander Bartlett lead to his conviction for
manslaughter
and
cruelty to children
in 1904, though a 1905 ruling by the
Maine Supreme Court
reversed the convictions. Sandford then sailed to
Jerusalem
on multiple missionary voyages. In 1910, he traveled aboard the
barquentine
Kingdom
to Africa with more than seventy men, women, and children. In March 1911,
Kingdom
went aground and was destroyed off the coast of
French West Africa
, an event that inspired Sandford to sail to
Greenland
in an attempt create a
mission station
there. Because he knowingly sailed with insufficient food and supplies, six crew members were stricken with
scurvy
and died on his return to
Portland
.
Sandford was detained by authorities and sentenced to seven years in the
federal penitentiary in Atlanta
. While there, he sent letters to his followers that were distributed among members of his commune. In 1918, Sandford was released on good behavior and returned to the "Shiloh", resuming his responsibilities after previously attempting to install his son, John, as leader. Nevertheless, two years later, the death of another commune member led his sect to be forcibly dispersed in "the Scattering". After the commune was
evacuated by law
, Sandford moved to
New York
's
Catskill Mountains
to be closer to God. On March 4, 1948, Sandford died and his body was secretly buried by his followers. All of his belongings burned in various
house fires
. Although his absence retarded the growth of the small sect, it survived, in
attenuated
form, into the 21st century with the creation of the Kingdom Christian Ministries in 1998.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Frank Sandford was born in
Bowdoinham
,
Maine
, the tenth child of a farming family.
[1]
An early companion recalled young Sandford as a natural leader, stating that he was always the one who "drove the horse and steered the boat"; if they played ball, "he was always a captain."
[2]
Sandford's father died when he was age 14, and by age 16 he was teaching school during an era in which physical prowess was often necessary to establish classroom discipline.
[3]
During his second year of teaching, Sandford reluctantly attended a
revival meeting
at his mother's
Free Will Baptist
church and was converted on February 29, 1880. He threw away his tobacco and announced his conversion publicly, not only at church but also at
Nichols Latin School
, where worldly
cosmopolitanism
was the preferred pose.
[4]
Entering
Bates College
on a general scholarship, Sandford was elected class president and served as both coach and catcher of the
baseball
team.
[5]
He graduated in 1886 with honors and was chosen to give a commencement address.  For one summer Sandford captained a semi-pro baseball team and was approached by professional scouts. After a teammate ridiculed him for attending church during Maine's
Fast Day
, he returned to Bates to attend
Cobb Divinity School
.
[6]
Frustrated by the seminary's mixture of formalism and
religious modernism
, Sandford later said that
God
had addressed him directly with words from the
gospel of Matthew
: "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." For the rest of his life he distrusted academic religion.
[7]
Soon thereafter, at age 24, Sandford dropped out of seminary after he was called as pastor by the Free Will Baptist church in
Topsham, Maine
.
[8]
He was frenetically energetic, and within three years his revivals resulted in three hundred conversions and more than a hundred
baptisms
. Besides serving as pastor, he became principal of the Topsham schools and organized sports programs for both local children and workers at a paper mill.
[9]
Early travels
[
edit
]
Beginning in 1887, Sandford's religious views changed dramatically. In July, he attended
Dwight L. Moody
’s "College of Colleges" at
Northfield Mount Hermon School
in
Northfield
,
Massachusetts
, the second annual meeting of the
Student Volunteer Movement
.
[10]
The college men who attended represented a revival of interest in foreign missions among more privileged Americans.
[11]
Moody himself provided Sandford with three key religious concepts: personal holiness, living by faith, and informal preaching.
[12]
Shortly thereafter, Sandford read
Hannah Whitall Smith
's
The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life
(1875).
[13]
Smith was an exponent of "
higher life
" Christianity; but what most attracted Sandford was her "emphasis on action, on a life that acts on faith, that obeys by doing."
[14]
Later that fall, Sandford was present for a religious conference that featured the Rev.
A. B. Simpson
, who had come to Maine specifically to organize the
Christian and Missionary Alliance
. Simpson's ministry emphasized not only missions and deeper life holiness but also
faith healing
. It was at this conference that Sandford met Helen Kinney, the daughter of a wealthy cotton broker, who had surrendered a career in art to become a foreign missionary.
[15]
The following year, in the summer of 1888, Sandford attended the
Niagara Bible Conference
, which emphasized the imminent,
premillennial
return of
Jesus Christ
.
[16]
These diverse, yet related, strands of late 19th-century
evangelicalism
came together for Sandford after he accepted the pastorate of a more affluent Free Will Baptist church in
Somersworth
,
New Hampshire
. Following a period of
emotional depression
—perhaps a
nervous breakdown
—he was temporarily released by his church after the denomination invited him and another young minister to travel around the world.
[17]
Sandford visited
Japan
,
China
,
India
, and the
Ottoman Empire
. In China he toured the
China Inland Mission
of
Hudson Taylor
, where he noted with admiration that "all depend upon God for support and divide their supplies equally"—a model for his own Shiloh.
[18]
Visiting the Holy Land, he developed a lifelong passion for more knowledge about it, but he nearly died when his steamer sank off
Jaffa
.
[19]
Pre-Shiloh activities
[
edit
]
After Sandford's return to the United States, the pastorate seemed tame, his congregation narrow-minded. In August 1891, Sandford had two strange experiences: he tentatively, but (at least according to his own testimony) successfully, cast
demons
out of a friend; and the following morning, he heard whispered in the trees the single word: "
Armageddon
." Shortly thereafter, Sandford convinced Kinney, whom he had met again as a missionary in Japan, to marry him. When he suggested leaving the pastorate and preaching the gospel without visible support, she replied, "I think it would be lovely."
[20]
On New Year's Day, 1893, Sandford told his church that God had told him, "Go." He resigned his pulpit and gave away his savings in the teeth of an
economic panic and depression
.
[21]
Sandford and his wife then began holding meetings in rural Maine—at the beginning with virtually no congregations and no financial support.
[22]
Eventually he achieved some success among people in Maine's coastal hill regions and contributions came in plentifully, although Sandford did not solicit money or even pass a collection plate.
[23]
By the fall of 1894, Sandford believed that he no longer bore responsibility for his actions, that he need only respond to the movings of the
Holy Spirit
.
[24]
Thus abandoning the Free Will Baptists, he began to issue a monthly magazine,
Tongues of Fire from the World's Evangelization Crusade on Apostolic Principles
, in which he advertised for other workers to join him in his ministry.
[25]
A year later, with a small but committed following of young people, Sandford announced the opening of a school, soon given the name "Holy Ghost and Us Bible School." The school charged no
tuition
, offered no courses, and had no teachers except Sandford himself and no textbooks except the
Bible
.
[26]
Shiloh
[
edit
]
In 1896, Sandford became convinced that God had told him to build a home for the Bible school on a sandy hill near
Durham, Maine
.
[27]
Despite having on three cents in his pocket, he kept faith that God would provide the means of putting up a building without his explicitly asking for money. Although Sandford eventually decided that publishing a list of needs in his
Tongues of Fire
would be acceptable, the manner in which the money and volunteer labor was provided by supporters was nearly miraculous in any case.
[28]
Sandford had intended to name only
the school's main building
"Shiloh" (after a
place in the Bible
), but the name "Shiloh" was obviously more mellifluous than "The Holy Ghost and Us" and it became the informal name of his movement.
[29]
Shiloh (c. 1901)
At its height, the Shiloh had more than six hundred residents who attempted to "live in the supernatural." None worked for pay, and all depended on God to supply their material needs. To live at Shiloh meant to "be in a constant state of readiness for the 'Holy Spirit's latest,' as Sandford put it. This meant no settling into ruts of any kind. It meant being ready to do any job, especially those you were least adept at....It meant being open to last-minute changes in schedule."
[30]
What little schedule there was consisted of one or two hours of private devotions in the morning, breakfast and kitchen chores, prayer at 9:00am, classes until noon, and lunch before personal household or office duties. The schedule might be interrupted at any moment by some special request for prayer; "God's work could not be crammed into a human schedule, and fussy ideas about order were not appropriate."
[31]
Theological development
[
edit
]
Except for celebrating
Jewish Feasts
and keeping the
Sabbath
on Saturday, Sandford's theology was, at this point, not far from mainstream evangelicalism. Nevertheless, because he believed that Thursday was the day on which Jesus was crucified, he and his followers prayed for six hours (from 9:00am to 3:00pm) on that day.
[32]
In the summer of 1896, Sandford publicly discussed the
two witnesses
mentioned in the
Book of Revelation
who would appear before Christ's
Second Coming
, and he declared that his school would "stand by and if need be die" with them.
[33]
When Sandford's son John was born shortly after the dedication of Shiloh, he said that (like
John the Baptist
), the boy had been "filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb."
[34]
British Israelism
[
edit
]
By 1898, Sandford had found additional spiritual and material support among Higher Life Christians in
Boston
and
London
, and he concluded that God now wanted him to establish an outpost in Ottoman-controlled Palestine. Visiting
Jerusalem
for the first time, he dashed off a paper announcing that the
Ten Lost Tribes
were England and the U.S., blood descendants of the ancient Hebrews who had been carried into captivity by the
Assyrians
in 721 BC.
[35]
British Israelism
was a religious version of
ideas about Anglo-Saxon supremacy
that were common to the contemporary English-speaking world, and the doctrine made the Bible all the more relevant because its prophecies seemed to apply to the people of Shiloh and the nation of which it was a part.
[36]
Divine healing
[
edit
]
By the early 20th century, the doctrine of divine healing had become an important part of Sandford's teaching. Initially skeptical, he resolved to “preach that part of the Bible” after attending an 1887 meeting where A. B. Simpson had spoken on the subject. In 1897, Sandford had witnessed and praised the miracles of contemporary faith healer
John Alexander Dowie
.
[37]
Soon
Tongues of Fire
reported healings of
pneumonia
,
cancer
,
diphtheria
,
catarrh
, "
sick headache
," sprained wrist,
dropsy
,
typhoid
,
mental derangement
, broken bones, and "utter exhaustion."
[38]
A local three-year-old girl who had been pronounced permanently blind by medical authorities suddenly regained her sight after prayer was offered for her at Shiloh.
[39]
But the most spectacular case was the "resurrection" of Olive Mills, who had been seriously ill, perhaps with
spinal meningitis
. Told Mills was dead, Sandford found her without breath or pulse. In desperation he shouted, "Olive Mills! Come back! In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, come back!" Almost immediately, Mills opened her eyes, and within a few hours she was out of bed and dressed.
[40]
Sandford believed the
Epistle of James
compelled Christians who were sick to call church elders for prayer and the
laying on of hands
, and he criticised Christians who sought treatment from physicians. He believed that illness might be the result of either discipline from God or an attack of
Satan
; but casting out demons required “prevailing prayer,” an exercise that included such protracted fervency and shouting that one skeptic became apprehensive as what sounded “like a hundred people talking at once” concluded with a woman’s screams piercing the din.
[41]
In 1899, Sandford received a divine message to complete a hospital in a hasty building drive—a technique frequently employed at Shiloh—but it was a hospital in which doctors were permitted only for diagnoses and consultations. No medicines of any kind were provided.
[42]
Among those influenced by these early developments at Shiloh were
A. J. Tomlinson
, founder of the
Church of God
; and
Charles Fox Parham
, one of the founders of the
Pentecostal
movement.
[43]
Acting for God
[
edit
]
By end of the century, Sandford became convinced "that as the passive agent of God's will, he could require exact and total obedience." Furthermore, as Hiss has written, to skeptics "Sandford's language vibrated with
blasphemy
, for in describing his own prayers as God's actions, he seemed to regard himself as having divine powers."
[44]
Inevitably, Sandford encountered opposition. A brief follower published an exposé,
Sanfordism Exposed
,
[45]
and relatives of converts who wished to
deed
their property to Shiloh tried to have them declared insane.
[46]
Although the town of Durham benefited from levying taxes on the residential portions of Shiloh, they also feared that
block voting
by Shiloh residents might dominate the town meeting, the school board, or the board of selectmen or that, in the event of
bankruptcy
, its members might become dependent on town charity.
[47]
More serious threats arose from among Sandford's own followers. The movement claimed to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, but conflict developed when members disagreed about where the Holy Spirit was leading.
[48]
In September 1900, Sandford announced that there would henceforth be an official chain of authority: God the Father, God the Son, the prophet whom God had chosen, ordained ministers subordinate to the prophet, everyone else subordinate to the ministers, with women and children also subordinate to their husbands and fathers.
[49]
He then instituted an organized
purge
of members that "incorporated not just confession, but long day and night sessions of open and unrelenting criticism of each other. One's capacity to accept that scouring in a contrite and cooperative spirit, without resentment or defensiveness, was the first step in passing the grade." One by one, individuals were then brought before Sandford himself for final scrutiny by "the seven eyes of God."
[50]
Sandford also developed a three-tiered membership in his religious system:
[51]
those willing to be "100-fold warriors" would be supported by 60- and 30-fold members who would live in their own homes and continue to work. In 1901, to make a clean break with the past, he instituted
closed communion
and rebaptized all local members of Shiloh in the nearby
Androscoggin River
.
[52]
Identification with Elijah and David
[
edit
]
Shortly thereafter, Sandford announced that God had spoken three words to him "like a thunderbolt": "
Elijah
is Here!" And it was as Elijah that Sandford now called down God's judgment on "every lying pen," editors who had written critically "about this man of God."
[53]
As usual, Sandford was also making an eschatological reference: he believed that, as Elijah, he would be one of the two witnesses of Revelation 11, who would be martyred and rise from the dead in Jerusalem before the coming of Christ's kingdom.
[54]
The "Elijah" announcement was met with increased ridicule from the press and led to the breaking of all ties with followers of Moody and Simpson.
[55]
In 1902, after once again visiting Jerusalem, Sandford received a divine message that indicated that in some way, he was also the biblical
David
. He had a portrait of himself printed encircled by the words "David careth for the Sheep," and he immediately renamed his movement "The Kingdom."
[56]
Manslaughter trial
[
edit
]
Sandford returned to Maine to find his community at what he considered a low spiritual ebb, with many members ill from diseases including
smallpox
. Peers were encouraged to closely examine each other's lives for sin, and parents regularly whipped children, a practice Sandford apparently condoned as the "schoolmaster to bring them to Christ."
[57]
In January 1903, Sandford instituted a "
Ninevah Fast
", forbidding all food or liquid for thirty-six hours even for infants, animals, and the sick. During that period, fourteen-year-old Leander Bartlett, who had confessed to the most serious sin of planning to run away from Shiloh, died of diphtheria.
[58]
When Sandford's own six-year-old son, John, disobeyed him, Sandford ordered him to
fast
without food or water until he declared himself glad to be whipped.
[59]
A prominent defector from the sect, Nathan Harriman, publicized John’s treatment and declared Sandford’s hold over the people of Shiloh a kind of
hypnotism
, in which God's requirements were "identical with those of Sandford.”
[60]
Many local residents took a dim view of Sandford, and newspapers engaged in "long-running campaigns against Shiloh." One editor denounced the commune as "a damnable institution, a hell upon earth and the worst blot that ever disgraced the fair pages of Maine's history."
[61]
In January 1904, Sandford was indicted by
Androscoggin County
on charges of
cruelty to children
and
manslaughter
—cruelty in the case of his son and manslaughter for his role in Bartlett's death. A jury convicted Sandford on the cruelty charge but was
hung
on the charge of manslaughter.
[62]
On
appeal
, the verdict in the cruelty case was upheld; and at retrial, Sandford was convicted of manslaughter.
In 1905, the
Maine Supreme Court
reversed the manslaughter conviction because the trial judge had required jurors to make a decision based on their own belief about the "efficacy of prayer as a means to cure the sick." Another jury trial resulted in another hung jury.
[63]
Meanwhile, Sandford had his followers sign a ten-foot scroll called the "Pledge of Loyalty," which included among its articles of faith a statement that "F. W. Sandford of Shiloh, Maine, U.S.A." was Elijah and David, and that "I believe in and accept him as such."
[64]
Circumnavigation on the
Coronet
[
edit
]
Coronet
(1894)
While his manslaughter case was still in the courts, Sandford purchased the racing
yacht
Coronet
, an extravagantly appointed
schooner
, for $10,000—raised in the usual Shiloh manner by prayer, "in this case, forty days and nights of it, with shifts for eating and sleeping."
[65]
Sandford made two quick trips to Jerusalem in 1905-06, but when his legal difficulties had ended, he and his thirty selected crewmen and passengers (including his wife and five children) circumnavigated the globe on what he described as a missionary journey.
[66]
It was an unconventional missionary enterprise. No one went ashore to preach the Gospel or even distribute religious literature. Sandford intended to "subdue the world for Christ" by intercessory prayer, claiming nations and isles for Christ by sounding brass instruments as they passed by.
[67]
Oddly, Sandford added a
taxidermist
to a crew of reasonably experienced seamen, and he included on a ship already filled to capacity both "eyes for stuffed animals and birds" and a large
harp
on which he took lessons.
[68]
There were moments of real peril, as when
Coronet
fought its way through the thundering seas around
Cape Horn
and then again after a powerful gale broke the
main sheet
and (indirectly) part of the mast almost immediately after Sandford had shot an
albatross
.
[69]
During calmer periods, Sandford had leisure enough to hunt and receive an occasional vision.
[70]
Later sea voyages
[
edit
]
Even before returning to Maine, Sandford heard that Florence Whittaker, a member of his outpost in Jerusalem, wanted to abandon the sect whether or not her minister husband (who had just accompanied Sandford on the multi-year circumnavigation) would leave with her. At this point, Sandford decided to bring back all his followers from Palestine, and Whittaker reluctantly agreed to accept passage to the U.S. on another Shiloh ship, the three-masted
barquentine
Kingdom
. She was treated with utmost courtesy until they reached the Maine coast, at which point Sandford refused to let her land until she was "adjusted" to her husband.
[71]
Eventually Whittaker was freed by court order and was then given custody of her children.
[72]
The story made sensational newspaper fare, especially when Whittaker sued Sandford for
forcible detention
. At the time Sandford was aboard
Coronet
, and authorities began watching ports to serve him the legal papers.
[73]
He determined that they would not find him, and that a mission station should be opened immediately in Africa and perhaps another in
Greenland
.
[74]
In December 1910, more than seventy men, women, and children headed off to Africa, divided between
Kingdom
and
Coronet
. In March 1911,
Kingdom
went aground and was destroyed off the coast of
French West Africa
. Sandford took everyone aboard
Coronet
, which now became fearfully overloaded with people and undersupplied with food and water.
[75]
Nevertheless, Sandford heard the supernatural direction, "Continue," which he interpreted to mean to sail on to Greenland. After recrossing the Atlantic to catch the northerly currents,
Coronet
passed up numerous opportunities to take on water and supplies, Sandford announcing that God had ordered him not to put into port in the U.S. or Canada.
[76]
Finally, on September 6, 1911, there was a "quiet
mutiny
" of some sort off the
Grand Banks
, and
Coronet
was turned south.
[77]
Unfortunately, the ship now made little headway, and the passengers and crew were saved from possible starvation only by the fortuitous appearance of the
ocean liner
S.S.
Lapland
, which provided some food—but ominously, no fruit or vegetables.
[78]
Almost before they knew what was happening, men began to fall victim to
scurvy
; and within a few days after
Coronet
reached
Portland
on October 21, 1911, scurvy had claimed the lives of six crew members. Sandford was first arrested on Whittaker's warrant and then, a few days later, for being responsible for the deaths—"unlawfully, knowingly, and willingly" allowing a ship to "proceed on a voyage at sea without sufficient provisions."
[79]
Trial, conviction, and imprisonment
[
edit
]
Sandford refused to employ legal counsel at the trial, although he did receive legal advice—which he rejected.
[80]
In court, he declared that the sickness and starvation aboard
Coronet
was punishment from God for refusing to obey his command to continue to Greenland. The jury brought in a guilty verdict within an hour. On December 17, 1911, Sanford was sentenced to serve not more than ten years at the
federal penitentiary
in
Atlanta
,
Georgia
.
[81]
Although Sandford accepted imprisonment as the will of God, he initially had difficulty bending to prison regulations. But with sleep, proper nourishment, and enforced exercise, his health gradually improved. He even insisted that Shiloh residents drop whatever they were doing at 11:30 and 4:00 and exercise with him. Sandford was made a gatekeeper and given a pass that allowed him to spend some time out of doors. He also volunteered to teach a group of prisoners how to read and write, and especially enjoyed conducting a weekly Bible class that began with one student and grew to more than a hundred. Eventually Shiloh was allowed to send Sandford a harp, and he was not only able to practice but gave at least two concerts at the prison.
[82]
Sandford had appointed seven ministers to share responsibility for leading the group, but his letters were treated like "a purse of gold." Many of them, even private letters to his family, were printed and distributed. Because prisoners were only allowed to send two letters a month, a sect member moved to Atlanta and took dictation during weekly visits.
[83]
Religious downfall
[
edit
]
During his imprisonment, Sandford tried to promote his teenaged son John as the new leader of The Kingdom, and he seems to have had some success at editing a new periodical,
The Golden Trumpet
.
[84]
But when, in 1915, John was put in charge of an
inquisitorial
board called the "Eye-of-the-Needle," intended to probe the souls of Shiloh residents, Sandford himself brought the experiment to a halt when his son incurred resentment and, in any case, proved temperamentally unsuited to the task. Shortly thereafter, Marguerite, one of Sandford's daughters, ran away from the community, a serious blow to his authority because of his insistence that leaders be able to "handle their children."
[85]
Given three years off for good behavior, Sandford was released from prison in September 1918. When he reappeared at Shiloh, he was served a sumptuous meal, although many residents had recently suffered serious illness and almost all, hunger. Sandford's return sparked new contributions and new healings, even food enough for two meals a day.
[86]
Nevertheless, three days after his arrival, another of Sandford's daughters ran away,
[87]
and a few months later he left Maine for the sect's Boston headquarters.
[88]
Furthermore, the sect had conducted virtually no evangelistic outreach since the beginning of Sandford's imprisonment in 1911.
[89]
The end of the Shiloh community came suddenly in 1920, after the death of Shiloh resident Elma Hastings and a suit brought by relatives for
guardianship
of her children on the grounds of non-support by their father. The Children's Protective Society of Maine, having investigated living conditions at Shiloh, urged that all minors be removed from the community.
[90]
In March 1920, Sandford sent the message, "Work."
[91]
No one anticipated that this directive would effectively end the Shiloh community within days. Two months later the prayer vigils had stopped, the Bible school was closed, and Shiloh's population had dropped from 370 to a handful.
[92]
As Nelson has written, once the men went off to the mills, everything changed. With "the assurance that they would never be hungry again," that their needs would be met in the same way everyone else's were met, "there was no reason to stay. They could be ordinary Christians anywhere."
[93]
Retirement
[
edit
]
Before Shiloh was finally deserted in May, Sandford heard the heavenly direction to, "Retire."
[94]
For the remainder of his life, he lived in seclusion near the village of
Hobart
,
New York
, in the
Catskill Mountains
. He prayed, farmed, raised sheep, studied
astronomy
, taught small groups, and gradually regathered his scattered followers into centers in different parts of the country. Messages were delivered to the faithful by a smaller inner circle.
[95]
Sandford continued to be supported by the
tithes
of his followers, and his retirement was "satisfying and serene," although his papers and books were twice destroyed in house fires.
[96]
To some degree Sandford relaxed his earlier rhetoric. On New Year's Eve, 1941, he received a message from God to "remit the sins of each and every person that has been baptized since October 1, 1901."
[97]
But he never renounced his claim to be Elijah; nor did he ever express remorse for those who had died on
Coronet
thirty years earlier.
[98]
Sandford's death on March 4, 1948, was quiet and peaceful. His funeral and interment, however, were hasty and secretive. The news of his death was not released to the press for six weeks. Sandford had, of course, not died as Elijah in Jerusalem, but as an unheralded inhabitant of a Catskill village.
[99]
Legacy
[
edit
]
The Kingdom continued after Sandford's death under the informal leadership of Victor Abram, his personal secretary, although Sandford never had a true successor.
[100]
At Abram’s death in 1977, his son-in-law, Joseph Wakeman, became leader but thought of himself "as more of a caretaker." The membership then gradually learned that Abram had had a series of extramarital affairs while leading an organization that emphasized moral purity.
[101]
A successor organization, Kingdom Christian Ministries—reorganized in 1998 after a split occasioned by continued debate over Sandford's theology
[101]
—has several hundred members at a few centers in the eastern United States.
[102]
An independent evangelical Christian church, Shiloh Chapel, meets in a remaining portion of the original Shiloh building in Durham, Maine; it is no longer affiliated with Kingdom Christian Ministries.
[103]
The building is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places
for its distinctive architecture and history.

James Johnson Sweeney
(1900-1986) was an American curator, and writer about modern art. Sweeney graduated from
Georgetown University
in 1922. From 1935 to 1946, he was curator for the
Museum of Modern Art
.
[1]
He was the second director of the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
, from 1952 to 1960. During his tenure, he expanded the scope of the collection to include
abstract expressionist
painting as well as sculpture, established the long term loans program in 1953, and the
Guggenheim International Award
in 1956. He was also involved in the final years of the construction of the
Frank Lloyd Wright
designed museum building during which time he had an antagonistic relationship with the architect.
[2]
Sweeney collected works by:
Alexander Archipenko
,
Constantin Brâncuși
,
Alberto Burri
,
Alexander Calder
,
César
,
Alberto Giacometti
,
Lucio Fontana
,
David Hayes
,
Willem de Kooning
,
Fernand Léger
,
Joan Miró
,
Piet Mondrian
,
Pablo Picasso
,
Jackson Pollock
and
Pierre Soulages
.
[3]
In the late 1960s, Sweeney was a consultant to the
National Gallery of Australia
during its establishment to advise on issues concerning the display and storage of art.  Subsequently, it also acquired paintings by Pollock and de Kooning.  The then Australian
Prime minister
,
John Gorton
apparently favoured him as the Gallery's first director, despite his age.  He also had significant input into its
brutalist
design.  According to the Gallery's first Director,
James Mollison
, "the size and form of the building had been determined between Colin Madigan and J.J. Sweeney, and the
National Capital Development Commission
.  I was not able to alter the appearance of the interior or exterior in any way...It's a very difficult building in which to make art look more important than the space in which you put the art".
[4]
Sweeney died April 14, 1986, in Manhattan.

Riwoche Monastery
, or
Riwoche Tsukla Khang Tragyelma
(Tib.

;
[1]
Ch.
Leiwuqi Si
) is a
Taklung Kagyu
monastery of the
Kagyu
school of
Tibetan Buddhism
. It was founded in 1276 by Sangye On, and is one of the oldest and largest monasteries in eastern Tibet. A highly respected
Kham
regional monastery, it's also famous for its philosophers and logicians, and for the red, black and white painted tree-trunk columns.
Riwoche Monastery is situated 29 km north of the small town of Ratsaka (also known as Riwoche Town), and 134 km west of
Chamdo
in
Kham
. It is at an altitude of about 3,400 metres (11, 152 ft) in a fertile valley containing the Dzi River, a tributary to the
Mekong River
.
[2]
History
[
edit
]
Sanggye On Drakpa Pel
, founder of Riwoche Monastery
Riwoche was founded in 1276 CE by
Sangye On
, who was a student of Sangye Yarjon, the third lineage-holder of the Taklung branch of the
Kagyu
School of Tibetan Buddhism,
[1]
and Abbot of
Taklung Monastery
. He had promised the abbot's chair to two nephews, Onpo (1251-1296) and Mangalaguru. When Yarjon died, Onpo, just a young man, assumed the hierarch's position for one year. His older cousin, Mangalaguru (1231-1297), later took control of the monastery.
[3]
Later, Onpu's disciple Choku Orgyan Gonpo (1293-1366), became second abbot of Riwoche.
It became the main branch of the Taklung Kagyu in Kham and, according to
Go Lotsawa
, the author of the
Blue Annals
, it once had as many as 2,000 monks, and held the greatest reputation among
Khampa
monasteries. Riwoche Monastery is also famous for its monks' capabilities in philosophy and in logic.
[4]
From the time of its founding, the Taklung lineage was divided into "upper" and "lower" branches, Riwoche forming the "lower" branch.
[5]
Today there are 305 monks residing at Riwoche Monastery.
[6]
Description
[
edit
]
Riwoche Monastery in 1988, under reconstruction. Photo: S Jones
The main temple is three-storied and has been undergoing restoration since 1985, after its earlier destruction by Chinese communists.
[7]
It is very imposing, supported by huge tree trunks and painted in black red and white vertical stripes, which is distinctive of the Taklung lineage. The monastery contained a notable 14th-century cloth painting entitled
Jnanatapa
which was unearthed in recent years.
[3]
The central figure depicts the Onpo Lama Rinpoche and the spiritual lineage of Riwoche monastery.
The surrounding community of practitioners includes both members of the Kagyu and
Nyingma
schools, some of whom are married.

Eileen Lynn Kato
(23 March 1932 - 31 August 2008)
[1]
was an Irish academic, translator and expert in Japanese poetry and theatre.
In 1991, she was appointed to the Japanese Imperial Household as a
goyogakari
(advisor), a post she held until 2007, shortly before her death.  She was the first foreigner to hold such a position.
[2]
In addition to being an authority on Japanese poetry and theatre, and Waka art, she had a deep knowledge of Old-Middle English, Old Irish, Medieval French and Classical Japanese.
[3]
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Eileen Lynn was born in
Bangor Erris
on 23 March 1932, daughter of Jimmy Lynn from Briska, a townland just outside Bangor Erris, and Mary (née Tracy), originally from Galway. She attended the Ursuline Convent school in Sligo, and progressed to
University College Galway
, where in 1953 she secured a first class honours degree in French and Spanish.
[1]
In 1954 she won a scholarship from the French government, and attended the University of
Poitiers
, where she earned an MA, and then, having won a second scholarship, she attended the
Sorbonne
in Paris.  When her husband was posted to the United Nations in New York during the 1960s, she completed a second MA, in Japanese Studies, at Columbia University, partly under the supervision of renowned scholar
Donald Keene
.
[1]
Academic and cultural career
[
edit
]
Kato's work primarily focused on translations mostly from Japanese to English.  She also translated
waka
poems - Japan’s traditional poetic form -  into Irish and English Irish poetry.  Her work was included in several collections, including
Twenty Plays of the Noh Theatre.
She also wrote poetry, including waka.
[1]
While living in Japan, Kato developed an expertise in the
Noh theatre
- the classic form of Japanese dance and drama.  She frequently attended the theatre and she counted many famous Noh actors as personal friends.
[1]
She also published a number of articles about Irish and Japanese literature in academic journals such as
Monumenta Nipponica
.
[4]
Personal life
[
edit
]
While in
Poitiers
, she met her husband,
Yoshiya Kato
, who was a Japanese diplomat serving in
France
. The marriage was only the second case since
World War II
in which a Japanese diplomat married a foreign national, and the marriage required the approval of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs
. They lived in various locations including the US, China and Egypt, and conversed in French.  Kato also became a Japanese citizen.

Sidetracks: Explorations of a Romantic Biographer
collects his shorter pieces, including an early, groundbreaking essay on
Thomas Chatterton
and an introductory account of the lives and works of
Mary Wollstonecraft
and
William Godwin
.
He is editor of the
Harper Perennial
series Classic Biographies, launched in 2004.
His 2005 monograph on biography and portraiture for the
National Portrait Gallery
,
Insights: The Romantic Poets and their Circle
, was unusual in that it included scientists alongside literary writers. He has also written many drama-documentaries for
BBC Radio
, most recently The
Frankenstein Experiment
(2002), and
A Cloud in a Paper Bag
(2007) about 18th century balloon mania.
October 2008 saw his first major work of biography in over a decade,
The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science
, published by HarperPress. In it he explores the scientific ferment that swept across Britain at the end of 18th century. Holmes proposes a radical vision of
science
before
Charles Darwin
, exploring the earliest ideas of
deep time
and
deep space
, the creative rivalry with the
French scientific establishment
, and the startling impact of discovery on great writers and poets such as
Mary Shelley
,
Coleridge
,
Byron
and
Keats
. The book received wide review coverage (see below), was featured on
BBC Radio 4
's
Book of the Week
[4]
and became a best-seller.
[5]
In
Falling Upwards: How We Took to the Air
(2013), Holmes approaches the
history of ballooning
by presenting biographies of French, English, and American balloonists.
[6]
The personalities and experiences of those involved are varied and surprising. Balloons were used successfully to send information out of
besieged Paris
in 1870, and unsuccessfully to fly to the North Pole in the 1890s, to name only two examples. In Holmes' history of ballooning, science meets showmanship and both literary flights and actual adventures capture the imagination.

The
Women's Franchise Union (WFU)
, was an organization for
Women's suffrage in Sri Lanka
, founded in 1927.
[1]
It was the first organization to campaign in a systematic way for women's suffrage in Sri Lanka, as well as the main organization for the purpose.
[2]
In 1909, the
Ceylon Women's Union
from 1904 first lifted the issue of women's suffrage, and in 1925, the Mallika Kulangana Samitiya first lifted a resolution at the sessions at the
Ceylon National Congress
in favor of the reform. In 1927 therefore, Women's Franchise Union was founded to campaign for the issue with
Mary Rutnam
and
Agnes Nell
among its founders.
[3]
[4]
Agnes De Silva
was secretary of the Ceylon Franchise Union. She led an organized delegation of women members of the Franchise Union to present their case at the 1928
Donoughmare Commission on Constitutional Reform
, which the
British Government
then in control of the island had constituted. They advocated for suffrage to be granted to women thirty years of age and older. The reforms she introduced later became a part of new constitution established in 1931. After the new constitution came into force the adult franchise was extended to women above the age of 21, regardless of their educational status.

as an airborne battalion supply officer and rifle company commander.
Following a traumatic event in which a team of surgeons and critical care doctors saved his father's life, Green requested that the Army send him to medical school. He attended the
Boonshoft School of Medicine
at Wright State University, graduating with a
Doctor of Medicine
in 1999.
[4]
He did his residency in emergency medicine at

[5]
during his service.
Civilian career
[
edit
]
Green founded and served as
chief executive officer
of Align MD, a hospital emergency department management staffing company. Align MD provides staffing to emergency departments and hospital services in 50 hospitals in 10 states.
[10]
Green also founded Two Rivers Medical Foundation, which provides health care to underserved populations worldwide via medical mission trips, and operates a free medical clinic in his hometown and in Memphis, Tennessee.
[10]
Green served on the boards of several for-profit companies, including American Physician Partners, Align MD, and Rural Physician Partners. Green is also a board member of the Middle Tennessee Boy Scouts of America. He has served on the advisory board of the political organization Latinos for Tennessee since 2015.
In 2015,
Williamson College
awarded Green an honorary
Doctorate of Humanities
.
[10]
[11]
Political career
[
edit
]
Tennessee State Senate
[
edit
]
Green was first elected to the
Tennessee Senate
in 2012, defeating
Democratic
incumbent
Tim Barnes
.
[5]
[12]
[13]
He was rumored to be considering a challenge to
Lamar Alexander
in the
2014 U.S. Senate election
,
[14]
but declined to do so.
[15]
Green is most noteworthy for his legislation ending Tennessee's Hall Income Tax, only the second time in US history a state has repealed an income tax.
[16]
He also co-sponsored a bill that eliminated the statute of limitations on rape cases where the DNA profile of the suspect is known.
[17]
Green received awards recognizing his many laws protecting veterans and small businesses.
[18]
[19]
He led the charge in Tennessee for automated technology in auto manufacturing, speaking at national conferences on the topic.
[20]
In 2015, Green proposed a pilot program to test an innovative solution to health care. The idea was to give Medicaid patients a reduced amount of health care dollars on a swipe card, giving them choice and control. The incentive is that any dollars not spent go to the patient as an addition to their earned income check. SJR 88 passed and was signed by the governor. The request for a waiver to test the program is at CMS for approval.
[21]
Green won the 2016 Republican primary 84% to 16% over Lori Smith of
Clarksville, Tennessee
.
[22]
In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee David Cutting, 67% to 33%.
Nomination as U.S. Army Secretary
[
edit
]
In April 2017, President
Donald Trump
nominated Green for
United States Secretary of the Army
.
[23]
Green was Trump's second nominee for this position after his first nominee,
Vincent Viola
, withdrew from consideration.
[24]
Green drew some opposition based on public comments about transgender people.
[25]
At a September 2016
Tea Party
gathering in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Green said, "If you polled the psychiatrists, they're going to tell you that transgender is a disease."
[26]
He also supported a state law that limited access to
public restrooms for transgender people
to those matching their legal sex, not their gender identity, and told internet radio talk show host CJ Porter that he viewed his support of that law as part of his duty as a state senator to "crush evil".
[26]
[27]
Green also said that if school districts "want to have a bathroom that's separate for all of the, you know, guys or gals with question marks" but were concerned the "AFL-CIO is going to sue you, well, I got your back." It is assumed Green meant the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), not the
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations
(AFL-CIO).
[28]
Green also said that he would "not tolerate" students learning about Muslim beliefs and practices.
[29]
Green added later that he doesn't "think we should teach the Lord’s Prayer" in schools either. In a call for separation of church and state, he said, "Leave that to the churches, the synagogues, and the mosques."
[30]
Green withdrew his nomination on May 5, 2017.
[31]

United States Senate
, Green announced he was running for the open congressional seat.
[33]

Lamar Alexander
announced he would not seek reelection
in 2020
, Green was considered a likely candidate for the seat. But on July 11, 2019, he announced that he would not be a candidate.
[35]
In late February 2021, Green and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and
enlisted others to vote for them
, citing the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic
. But he and the other members were actually attending the
Conservative Political Action Conference
, which was held at the same time as their slated absences.
[36]
In response, the
Campaign for Accountability
, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the
House Committee on Ethics
and requested an investigation into Green and the other lawmakers.

, a lawsuit filed at the
United States Supreme Court
contesting the results
of the
2020 presidential election
, in which
Joe Biden
prevailed over incumbent

Vaccines
[

In 2018, as a congressman-elect, Green said at a constituent meeting, "there is some concern that the rise in autism is the result of the preservatives that are in our vaccines", a claim that has been

and rejected by medical organizations such as the

The
Gaslight Festival
[1]
is an annual festival held in
Jeffersontown, Kentucky
. It takes place the 3rd Weekend of September and the week prior
[2]
and is considered the unofficial start to fall in
Louisville
.

History
[
edit
]
In 1966 the Jeffersontown Restoration Society led by Peggy Weber and Petra Williams were remodeling Jefersontown's town square.  Jeffersontown had just built a new City Hall building in the Federal Style and the Restoration Society was able to convince business owners on the town square to remodel their store fronts in the same style.  During a separate renovation at a local church one of the original gaslights that lined the town square until 1912 was found under a stairwell. This prompted several replica gaslights to be built and installed in the newly renovated town square and eventually led to the town square's current name; Gaslight Square.  To showcase the new renovations and promote the businesses there a festival was held.
[4]
The inaugural Gaslight Festival was held on June 7, 1970, immediately preceding the Jeffersontown Community Fair scheduled for June 10-13.  Although the festival was originally conceived to promote the Gaslight Square it was decided by Mayor Franklin Chambers that the square was too new and clean to risk throwing a party there.  Instead it was held at J-Town Center.
[4]
The first Gaslight Festival has a half-day event
[5]
and included a parade that went from City Hall to the Jeffersontown Community Center and carnival rides.
[2]
The first festival was a success but was overshadowed by that year's Jeffersontown Community Fair.
[4]
The second Gaslight Festival in 1971 was again held in June but was Gaslight Square where has been held ever since. The third Gaslight Festival in 1972 was used to celebrate the 175th anniversary of Jeffersontown's founding and was a multi-day event held from September 30 to October 2. Attendance continued to grow and by 1977 it was estimated that 150,000 people attended the festival.
[4]
Although originally intended to supplement the Community Fair the Gaslight Festival would eventually replace it entirely.
[6]
The 28th festival celebrated the bicentennial, in 1997.
Today the festival is an eight-day event beginning the Sunday before the 3rd weekend in September and attracts over 200,000 visitors.
[7]
Making it the second largest festival in
Kentucky
behind the
Kentucky State Fair
,
[8]
fifth largest in the region,
[9]
and in the top 20 in the
southeast
.
[10]
Over this eight-day stretch several events take place such as a motorcycle rally, 5K road race, and a parade culminating with the gaslight festival weekend.
[5]
The gaslight festival weekend is a three-day street festival with over 250 booths, live music, and carnival rides.
[11]
After being mostly virtual during 2020 in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic
the live events were reinstated in 2021.

Preceded by
Roman navy
The
Byzantine navy
was the
naval force
of the
Byzantine Empire
. Like the state it served, it was a direct continuation from its
Roman predecessor
, but played a far greater role in the defence and survival of the state than its earlier iteration. While the fleets of the
Roman Empire
faced few great naval threats, operating as a policing force vastly inferior in power and prestige to the
army
,
command of the sea
became vital to the very existence of the Byzantine state, which several historians have called a "maritime empire".
[5]
[6]
The first threat to Roman hegemony in the
Mediterranean Sea
was posed by the
Vandals
in the 5th century, but their threat was ended by the wars of
Justinian I
in the 6th century. The re-establishment of a permanently maintained fleet and the introduction of the
dromon
galley in the same period also marks the point when the Byzantine navy began departing from its late Roman roots and developing its own characteristic identity. This process would be furthered with the onset of the
early Muslim conquests
in the 7th century. Following the loss of the
Levant
and later Africa, the Mediterranean was transformed from a "Roman lake" into a battleground between the Byzantines and a series of Muslim states. In this struggle, the Byzantine fleets were critical, not only for the defence of the Empire's far-flung possessions around the Mediterranean basin, but also for repelling seaborne attacks against the imperial capital of
Constantinople
itself. Through the use of the newly invented "
Greek fire
", the Byzantine navy's best-known and feared secret weapon, Constantinople was saved from
several sieges
and numerous naval engagements resulted in Byzantine victories.
Initially, the defence of the Byzantine coasts and the approaches to Constantinople was borne by the great fleet of the
Karabisianoi
. Progressively however it was split up into several
regional
fleets, while a central Imperial Fleet was maintained at Constantinople, guarding the city and forming the core of naval expeditions. By the late 8th century, the Byzantine navy, a well-organized and maintained force, was again the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean. Conflicts with navies of the
Muslim world
continued with alternating success, but in the 10th century, the Byzantines were able to gain supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean.
During the 11th century, the navy, like the Empire itself, began to decline. Faced with new naval challenges from the West, the Byzantines were increasingly forced to rely on the navies of Italian city-states such as
Venice
and
Genoa
, with disastrous effects on the Empire's economy and sovereignty. A
period of recovery
under the
Komnenos dynasty
was followed by another period of decline, which culminated in the disastrous dissolution of the Empire by the
Fourth Crusade
in 1204. After the Empire was restored in 1261, several emperors of the
Palaiologan dynasty
attempted to revive the navy, but their efforts only had a temporary effect. Emperor
Andronikos II Palaiologos
even dissolved the navy completely, allowing Venice to defeat the Byzantines in two wars, the first of which resulted in a humiliating treaty that saw the Venetians keep multiple islands captured from Byzantine forces during the war and forced the latter to repay Venice for the destruction of Constantinople's Venetian quarter at the hands of the city's Genoese residents. By the mid-14th century, the Byzantine fleet, which once could put hundreds of warships to sea, was limited to a few dozen at best, and control of the
Aegean Sea
definitively passed to Italian navies and, in the 15th century, the nascent
Ottoman Navy
. The diminished Byzantine navy continued to be active until the
fall of Constantinople
to the
Ottoman Empire
in 1453.

Early period
[

Civil wars and barbarian invasions: the 4th and 5th centuries
[
edit
]
By the late 5th century, the Western Mediterranean had fallen into the hands of barbarian kingdoms. The conquests of Justinian I restored Roman control over the entire sea, which would last until the Muslim conquests in the latter half of the 7th century.
The Byzantine navy, like the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire itself, continued the systems of the
Roman Empire
. After the
Battle of Actium
in 31 BC, in the absence of any external threat in the Mediterranean, the Roman navy performed mostly policing and escort duties. Massive sea battles, like those fought centuries before in the
Punic Wars
(264 to 146 BC), no longer occurred, and the Roman fleets comprised relatively small vessels, best suited to their new tasks. By the early 4th century AD, the permanent Roman fleets had dwindled, so that when the fleets of the rival emperors
Constantine the Great
and
Licinius
clashed in 324 AD
,
[7]
they were composed to a great extent of newly built or -commandeered ships from the port cities of the Eastern Mediterranean.
[8]
The civil wars of the 4th and early 5th centuries, however, did spur a revival of naval activity, with fleets mostly employed to transport armies.
[9]
Considerable naval forces continued to be employed in the Western Mediterranean throughout the first quarter of the fifth century, especially from North Africa, but Rome's mastery of the Mediterranean was challenged when Africa was overrun by the
Vandals
[10]
(429 to 442).
The new
Vandalic Kingdom
of
Carthage
, under the capable
Geiseric
(
r.
428-477
), immediately launched raids against the coasts of Italy and Greece, even
sacking and plundering
Rome in 455.
[11]
The Vandal raids continued unabated over the next two decades, despite repeated Roman attempts to defeat them.
[11]
The Western Empire was impotent, its navy having dwindled to almost nothing,
[12]
but the eastern emperors could still call upon the resources and naval expertise of the eastern Mediterranean. A first Eastern expedition in 448, however, went no further than Sicily, and in 460, the Vandals attacked and destroyed a Western Roman invasion fleet at
Cartagena
in Spain.
[11]
Finally, in 468, a huge Eastern expedition assembled under
Basiliscus
, reputedly numbering 1,113 ships and 100,000 men, but it failed disastrously. About 600 ships were lost to
fire ships
, and the financial cost of 130,000 pounds of gold and 700,000 pounds of silver nearly bankrupted the Empire.
[13]
This forced the Romans to come to terms with Geiseric and to sign a peace treaty. After Geiseric's death in 477, however, the Vandal threat receded.
[14]
Sixth century - Justinian restores Roman control over the Mediterranean
[
edit
]
The 6th century marked the rebirth of Roman naval power. In 508, as antagonism with the
Ostrogothic Kingdom
of
Theodoric
flared up, the Emperor
Anastasius I
(
r.
491-518
) is reported to have sent a fleet of 100 warships to raid the coasts of Italy.
[15]
In 513, the general
Vitalian
revolted against Anastasius. The rebels assembled a fleet of 200 ships which, despite some initial successes, were destroyed by admiral
Marinus
, who employed a sulphur-based incendiary substance to defeat them.
[16]
In 533, taking advantage of the absence of the Vandal fleet, sent to suppress a revolt in
Sardinia
, an army of 15,000 under
Belisarius
was transported to Africa by an invasion fleet of 92
dromons
and 500 transports,
[17]
beginning the
Vandalic War
, the first of the wars of the reconquest of Emperor
Justinian I
(
r.
527-565
). These were largely amphibious operations, made possible by the control of the Mediterranean waterways, and the fleet played a vital role in carrying supplies and reinforcements to the widely dispersed Byzantine expeditionary forces and garrisons.
[16]
This fact was not lost on the Byzantines' enemies. Already in the 520s, Theodoric had planned to build a massive fleet directed against the Byzantines and the Vandals, but his death in 526 limited the extent to which these plans were realized.
[18]
In 535, the
Gothic War
began with a double-pronged Byzantine offensive, with a fleet again carrying Belisarius' army to Sicily and then Italy, and another army invading
Dalmatia
. Byzantine control of the sea was of great strategic importance, allowing the smaller Byzantine army to successfully occupy the peninsula by 540.
[19]
In 541 however, the new Ostrogoth king,
Totila
, created a fleet of 400 warships with which to deny the seas around Italy to the Empire. Two Byzantine fleets were destroyed near Naples in 542,
[20]
and in 546, Belisarius personally commanded 200 ships against the Gothic fleet that blockaded the mouths of the
Tiber
, in an unsuccessful effort to
relieve Rome
.
[21]
In 550, Totila invaded Sicily, and over the next year, his 300-ship fleet captured Sardinia and
Corsica
, and raided
Corfu
and the coast of
Epirus
.
[22]
However, a defeat in a sea battle off
Sena Gallica
marked the beginning of the final Imperial ascendancy.
[16]
With the final conquest of Italy and
southern Spain
under Justinian, the Mediterranean once again became a "Roman lake".
[16]
Despite the subsequent loss of much of Italy to the
Lombards
, the Byzantines maintained control of the seas around the peninsula. As the Lombards rarely ventured to sea, the Byzantines were able to retain several coastal strips of Italian territory for centuries.
[23]
The only major naval action of the next 80 years occurred during the
siege of Constantinople
by the
Sassanid Persians
,
Avars
and Slavs in 626. During that siege, the Slavs' fleet of
monoxyla
was intercepted by the Byzantine fleet and destroyed, denying the
Persian army
passage across the
Bosporus
and eventually forcing the Avars to retreat.
[24]
Struggle against the Arabs
[
edit
]
Emergence of the Arab naval threat
[
edit
]
Further information on this period:
Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty
Map of the main Byzantine-Muslim naval operations and battles in the Mediterranean, 7th-11th centuries.
During the 640s, the
Muslim conquest
of
Syria
and
Egypt
created a new threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer significant recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of
Alexandria
in 644, they took to creating
a navy of their own
. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented northern part of the
Arabian peninsula
, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered
Levant
(especially the
Copts
of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines.
[25]
[26]
[27]
There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed.
[28]
The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about the specifics of the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities.
[29]
[30]
[31]
This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of
Byzantine military manuals
were available to the Arab admirals.
[29]
"At that time Kallinikos, an artificer from
Heliopolis
, fled to the Romans. He had devised a
sea fire
which ignited the Arab ships and burned them with all hands. Thus it was that the Romans returned with victory and discovered the sea fire."
Chronicle of
Theophanes the Confessor
,
Annus Mundi
6165.
[32]
After seizing
Cyprus
in 649 and raiding Rhodes, Crete and Sicily, the young Arab navy decisively defeated the Byzantines under the personal command of Emperor
Constans II
(641-668) in the
Battle of the Masts
of 655.
[33]
This catastrophic Byzantine defeat opened up the Mediterranean to the Arabs and began a centuries-long series of naval conflicts over the control of the Mediterranean waterways.
[33]
[34]
From the reign of
Muawiyah I
(661-680), raids intensified, as preparations were made for a great assault on Constantinople itself. In the long
first Arab siege
of Constantinople, the Byzantine fleet proved instrumental to the survival of the Empire: the Arab fleets were defeated through the use of its newly developed secret weapon, known as "
Greek fire
". The Muslim advance in Asia Minor and the Aegean was halted, and an agreement to a thirty-year truce concluded soon after.
[35]
In the 680s,
Justinian II
(
r.
685-695, 705-711
) paid attention to the needs of the navy, strengthening it by the resettlement of over 18,500
Mardaites
along the southern coasts of the Empire, where they were employed as
marines
and rowers.
[36]
Nevertheless, the Arab naval threat intensified as they
gradually took control
of
North Africa
in the 680s and 690s.
[37]
The last Byzantine stronghold, Carthage, fell in 698, although a Byzantine naval expedition managed to
briefly retake it
.
[38]
The Arab governor
Musa bin Nusair
built a new city and naval base at
Tunis
, and 1,000 Coptic shipwrights were brought to construct a new fleet, which would challenge Byzantine control of the western Mediterranean.
[39]
Thus, from the early 8th century on, Muslim raids unfolded unceasingly against Byzantine holdings in the Western Mediterranean, especially Sicily.
[28]
[40]
In addition, the new fleet would allow the Muslims to complete their conquest of the
Maghreb
and to
successfully invade and capture
most of the Visigoth-controlled Iberian Peninsula.
[41]
Byzantine counter-offensive
[
edit
]
Further information on this period:
Byzantine Empire under the Isaurian dynasty
Emperor
Leo III the Isaurian
and his son and successor,
Constantine V
. Together, they spearheaded a revival of Byzantine fortunes against the Arabs, but also caused great internal strife because of their
iconoclastic policies
.
The Byzantines were unable to respond effectively to the Muslim advance in Africa because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a
period of great domestic turmoil
.
[42]
They did react with raids of their own in the East, such as the one in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral,
[40]
but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph
al-Walid I
(
r.
705-715
) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor
Anastasios II
(
r.
713-715
) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations.
[42]
Anastasios was soon overthrown by
Theodosius III
(
r.
715-717
), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by
Leo III the Isaurian
(
r.
717-741
). It was Leo III who faced the second and final
Arab siege of Constantinople
. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and
Bulgar
attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.
[43]
In the aftermath of the siege, the retreating remains of the Arab fleet were decimated in a storm, and Byzantine forces launched a counter-offensive, with a fleet sacking
Laodicea
and an army driving the Arabs from Asia Minor.
[44]
[45]
For the next three decades, naval warfare featured constant raids from both sides, with the Byzantines launching repeated attacks against the Muslim naval bases in Syria (Laodicea), and Egypt (
Damietta
and
Tinnis
).
[40]
In 727, a revolt of the provincial
thematic
fleets, largely motivated by resentment against the Emperor's iconoclasm, was put down by the imperial fleet through the use of Greek fire.
[46]
Despite the losses this entailed, some 390 warships were reportedly sent to attack Damietta in 739, and in 746 the Byzantines decisively defeated the Alexandrian fleet at
Keramaia
in Cyprus, breaking the naval power of the
Umayyad Caliphate
.
[40]
The Byzantines followed this up with the destruction of the North African flotillas and coupled their successes at sea with severe trading limitations imposed on Muslim traders. Given the Empire's new ability to control the waterways, this strangled Muslim maritime trade.
[47]
With the collapse of the Umayyad state shortly thereafter and the increasing fragmentation of the Muslim world, the Byzantine navy was left as the sole organized naval force in the Mediterranean.
[40]
Thus, during the latter half of the 8th century, the Byzantines enjoyed a second period of complete naval superiority.
[26]
It is no coincidence that in the many
Islamic apocalyptic texts
composed and transmitted during the first and second Islamic centuries, the
End Times
are preceded by a seaborne Byzantine invasion. Many traditions from the period stress that manning the guard posts (
ribat
) on the coasts of Syria is tantamount to partaking in the
jihad
, and authorities like
Abu Hurayrah
were cited as considering one day of
ribat
more pious an act than a night of prayer in the
Kaaba
.
[48]
These successes enabled Emperor
Constantine V
(
r.
741-775
) to shift the fleet from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea during his campaigns against the Bulgars in the 760s. In 763, a fleet of 800 ships carrying 9,600 cavalries and some infantry sailed to
Anchialus
, where he scored a significant
victory
, but in 766, a second fleet, allegedly of 2,600 ships, again bound for Anchialus, sank
en route
.
[49]
At the same time, however, the
Isaurian
emperors undermined Byzantium's naval strength: with the Arab threat gone for the moment, and with the largely
iconodule
naval themes staunchly opposed to their
iconoclastic policies
, the emperors reduced the navy's size and downgraded the naval themes.
[50]
Renewed Muslim ascendancy
[
edit
]
The Saracen pirate fleet sails towards Crete. From the
Madrid Skylitzes manuscript
.
The Byzantine naval predominance lasted until the early 9th century when a succession of disasters at the hands of the resurgent Muslim fleets spelled its end and inaugurated an era that would represent the zenith of Muslim ascendancy.
[51]
[52]
Already in 790, the Byzantines suffered a major defeat in the
Gulf of Antalya
, and raids against Cyprus and Crete recommenced during the reign of
Harun al-Rashid
(786-809).
[53]
Around the Mediterranean, new powers were rising, foremost amongst them the
Carolingian Empire
, while in 803, the
Pax Nicephori
recognized the
de facto
independence of Byzantine
Venice
, which was further entrenched by the repulsion of a Byzantine attack in 809.
[54]
At the same time, in
Ifriqiya
, the new
Aghlabid
dynasty was established, which immediately engaged in raids throughout the central Mediterranean.
[54]
The Byzantines, on the other hand, were weakened by a series of catastrophic defeats against the Bulgars, followed in 820 by the
Revolt of Thomas the Slav
, which attracted the support of a large part of the Byzantine armed forces, including the thematic fleets.
[55]
Despite its suppression, the revolt had severely depleted the Empire's defences. As a result,
Crete
fell between 824 and 827 to a band of
Andalusian
exiles. Three successive Byzantine recovery attempts failed over the next few years, and the island became a base for Muslim piratical activity in the Aegean, radically upsetting the balance of power in the region.
[56]
[57]
Despite some Byzantine successes over the Cretan corsairs, and the
razing
of Damietta by a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships in 853,
[58]
Arab naval power in the Levant was steadily reviving under Abbasid rule.
[59]
Further Byzantine attempts to recover Crete, in 843 and 866, were complete failures.
[60]
"During that time [...] the Muslims gained control over the whole Mediterranean. Their power and domination over it was vast. The Christian nations could do nothing against the Muslim fleets, anywhere in the Mediterranean. All the time, the Muslims rode its wave for conquest."
Ibn Khaldun
,
Muqaddimah
, III.32
[61]
The situation was even worse in the West. A critical blow was inflicted on the Empire in 827, as the Aghlabids began the slow
conquest of Sicily
, aided by the defection of the Byzantine commander
Euphemios
and the island's thematic fleet.
[59]
[62]
In 838, the Muslims crossed over into Italy, taking
Taranto
and
Brindisi
, followed soon by
Bari
. Venetian operations against them were unsuccessful, and throughout the 840s, the Arabs were freely raiding Italy and the Adriatic, even
attacking Rome
in 846.
[62]
Attacks by the Lombards and
Lothair I
failed to dislodge the Muslims from Italy, while two large-scale Byzantine attempts to recover Sicily were heavily defeated in 840 and 859.
[63]
By 850, the Muslim fleets, together with large numbers of independent
ghazi
raiders, had emerged as the major power of the Mediterranean, putting the Byzantines and the Christians in general on the defensive.
[59]
[64]
The same period, when a battered Byzantium defended itself against enemies on all fronts, also saw the emergence of a new, unexpected threat: the
Rus'
made their first appearance in Byzantine history with a
raid against Paphlagonia
in the 830s, followed by a
major expedition
in 860.

Byzantine Reconquest: the era of the Macedonian dynasty
[
edit
]
Further information on this period:
Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty
During the course of the later 9th and the 10th century, as the Caliphate fractured into smaller states and Arab power became weakened, the Byzantines launched a series of successful campaigns against them.
[67]
This "Byzantine Reconquest" was overseen by the able sovereigns of the
Macedonian dynasty
(867-1056), and marked the noontide of the Byzantine state.
[68]
[69]
Reign of Basil I
[
edit
]
Gold
solidus
of Emperor
Basil I the Macedonian
. His patronage of the fleet resulted in several successes and was long remembered by the sailors, forming strong ties of loyalty to the Macedonian dynasty that was felt up until the reign of his grandson,
Constantine VII
.
[70]
The ascension of Emperor
Basil I
(867-886) heralded this revival, as he embarked on an aggressive foreign policy. Continuing the policies of his predecessor,
Michael III
(842-867), he showed great care to the fleet, and as a result, successive victories followed.
[71]
In 868, a fleet under the
droungarios tou ploïmou
Niketas Ooryphas
relieved
Ragusa
from an
Arab siege
and
re-established Byzantine presence
in the area.
[72]
A few years later, he twice heavily defeated the Cretan pirates at
Kardia
and in the
Corinthian Gulf
,
[73]
[74]
temporarily securing the Aegean.
[59]
Cyprus also was temporarily recovered and
Bari
occupied.
[75]
At the same time, however, the Muslim presence in
Cilicia
was strengthened, and
Tarsos
became a major base for land and seaborne attacks against Byzantine territory, especially under the famed emir
Yazaman al-Khadim
(882-891), despite the
heavy defeat
of one of his raids before
Euripos
.
[76]
In the West, the Muslims continued to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced to rely on the aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve any progress.
[77]
Following the fall of
Enna
in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little.
Syracuse
was attacked again in 869, and in 870,
Malta
fell to the Aghlabids.
[78]
Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of
Apulia
, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915.
[79]
In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, largely because the Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting
marble
for the construction of the
Nea Ekklesia
, Basil's new church.
[80]
In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the
droungarios
Nasar
, scored a significant victory in a
night battle
over the Aghlabids who were raiding the
Ionian Islands
. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before
defeating
another Muslim fleet off
Punta Stilo
. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples.
[81]
[82]
These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under
Nikephoros Phokas the Elder
, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and
Calabria
and forming the theme of
Longobardia
, which would later evolve into the
Catepanate of Italy
. A
heavy defeat
off
Milazzo
in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.
[59]
[83]
Arab raids during the reign of Leo VI
[
edit
]
The sack of Thessalonica by the Arabs under Leo of Tripoli in 904, as depicted in the Madrid Skylitzes manuscript. It was the most serious of a renewed wave of piratical raids by the Muslim navies in the Aegean Sea during Leo VI's reign.
Despite the successes under Basil, during the reign of his successor
Leo VI the Wise
(886-912), the Empire again faced serious threats. In the north, a war broke out against the Bulgarian Tsar
Simeon
, and a part of the Imperial Fleet was used in 895 to ferry an army of
Magyars
across the Danube to
raid Bulgaria
.
[84]
The Bulgarian war produced several costly defeats, while at the same time the Arab naval threat reached new heights, with successive raids devastating the shores of Byzantium's naval heartland, the Aegean Sea. In 891 or 893, the Arab fleet sacked the island of
Samos
and took its
strategos
(military governor) prisoner, and in 898, the eunuch admiral Raghib carried off 3,000 Byzantine sailors of the
Cibyrrhaeots
as prisoners.
[85]
These losses denuded Byzantine defences, opening the Aegean up to raids by the Syrian fleets.
[76]
The first heavy blow came in 901, when the renegade
Damian of Tarsus
plundered
Demetrias
, while in the next year,
Taormina
, the Empire's last outpost in Sicily,
fell to the Muslims
.
[86]
[85]
The greatest disaster, however, came in 904, when another renegade,
Leo of Tripoli
, raided the Aegean. His fleet penetrated even into the
Dardanelles
, before proceeding to
sack
the Empire's second city,
Thessalonica
, all while the Empire's fleet remained passive in the face of the Arabs' superior numbers.
[87]
Furthermore, the Cretan corsairs' raids reached such intensity, that by the end of Leo's reign, most of the southern Aegean islands were either abandoned or forced to accept Muslim control and pay tribute to the pirates.
[88]
It is no surprise that a defensive and cautious mindset was prevalent in Leo's contemporary instructions on naval warfare (
Naumachica
).
[59]
The most distinguished Byzantine admiral of the period was
Himerios
, the
logothetes tou dromou
. Appointed admiral in 904, he was unable to prevent the sack of Thessalonica, but he scored the first victory in 905 or 906, and in 910, he led a successful attack on Laodicea.
[89]
[90]
The city was sacked and its hinterland plundered and ravaged without the loss of any ships.
[91]
A year later, however, a huge expedition of 112 dromons and 75
pamphyloi
with 43,000 men, that had sailed under Himerios against the
Emirate of Crete
, not only failed to recover the island,
[92]
but on its return voyage, it was ambushed and comprehensively defeated by Leo of Tripoli off Chios (October 912).
[93]
[94]
The tide began to turn again after 920. Coincidentally, the same year witnessed the ascension of an admiral,
Romanos Lekapenos
(920-944), to the imperial throne, for the second (after
Tiberios Apsimaros
) and last time in the Empire's history. Finally, in 923, the decisive defeat of Leo of Tripoli off
Lemnos
, coupled with the death of Damian during a siege of a Byzantine fortress in the next year, marked the beginning of the Byzantine resurgence.
[95]
Recovery of Crete and the northern Levant
[
edit
]
The siege of
Chandax
, the main Muslim stronghold in Crete, as depicted in the
Madrid Skylitzes
manuscript. Nikephoros Phokas led a huge amphibious operation which recovered Crete for the Empire, thus securing the Aegean Sea from the Muslim pirate threat.
The Empire's growing might be displayed in 942, when Emperor Romanos I dispatched a squadron to the
Tyrrhenian Sea
. Using Greek fire, the squadron destroyed a fleet of Muslim corsairs from
Fraxinetum
.
[96]
In 949, however, another expedition of about 100 ships, launched by
Constantine VII
(945-959) against the Emirate of Crete, ended in disaster, due to the incompetence of its commander,
Constantine Gongyles
.
[97]
[98]
A renewed offensive in Italy in 951-952 was defeated by the
Fatimids
, but another expedition in 956 and the loss of an Ifriqiyan fleet in a storm in 958 temporarily stabilized the situation in the peninsula.
[96]
In 962, the Fatimids launched an assault on the remaining Byzantine strongholds on Sicily; Taormina fell on Christmas Day 962 and
Rometta
was besieged. In response, a major Byzantine expedition was launched in 964 but ended in disaster. The Fatimids defeated the Byzantine army before Rametta and then annihilated the fleet at the
Battle of the Straits
, notably through the use of divers bearing incendiary devices. Both powers focusing their attention elsewhere, a truce was concluded between Byzantium and the Fatimids in 967, which curbed Byzantine naval activity in the West: the seas of Italy were left to the local Byzantine forces and the various Italian states until after 1025, when Byzantium again actively intervened in southern Italy and Sicily.
[99]
[100]
In the East, in 956 the
strategos
Basil Hexamilites
inflicted a crushing defeat on the Tarsiot fleet, opening the way for another grand expedition to recover Crete.
[96]
It was entrusted to
Nikephoros Phokas
, who in 960 set out with a fleet of 100 dromons, 200
chelandia
, and 308 transports, carrying an overall force of 77,000 men, to subdue the island.
[101]
Although the navy ultimately had a limited combat role in the campaign, it was essential for keeping the sea-lanes open after a disastrous attack into the interior of the island required supplies to be brought in by sea.
[102]
The conquest of Crete removed the direct threat to the Aegean, Byzantium's naval heartland, while Phokas' subsequent operations led to the recovery of Cilicia (in 963), Cyprus (in 968),
[103]
and the northern Syrian coast (in 969).
[104]
These conquests removed the threat of the once mighty Muslim Syrian fleets, effectively re-establishing Byzantine dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean so that Nikephoros Phokas could boast to
Liutprand of Cremona
with the words "I alone command the sea".
[71]
[105]
A few raids and naval clashes occurred as antagonism with the Fatimids mounted in the late 990s, but peaceful relations were restored soon after, and the Eastern Mediterranean remained relatively calm for several decades to come.
[106]
During the same period, the Byzantine fleet was active in the Black Sea as well: a Rus' fleet that was
threatening Constantinople
in 941 was destroyed by 15 hastily assembled old ships equipped with Greek fire, and the navy played an important role in the
Rus'-Byzantine War of 970-971
, when
John I Tzimiskes
(969-976) sent 300 ships to blockade the
Kievan Rus'
from retreating over the Danube.
[107]
Komnenian period
[
edit

Further information on this period:
Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty
Decline during the 11th century
[

]
"Strive at all time to have the fleet in top condition and to have it not want for anything. For the fleet is the glory of
Rhōmania
. [...] The
droungarios
and
protonotarios
of the fleet should [...] investigate with rigor the slightest thing which is done to the fleet. For when the fleet is reduced to nothingness, you shall be overthrown and fall."
Admonitions to the Emperor, from the
Strategikon
of Kekaumenos, Ch. 87
[108]
Throughout most of the 11th century, the Byzantine navy faced few challenges. The Muslim threat had receded, as their navies declined and relations between the Fatimids, especially, and the Empire were largely peaceful. The last Arab raid against imperial territory was recorded in 1035 in the
Cyclades
, and was defeated in the next year.
[109]
Another
Rus' attack
in 1043 was beaten back with ease, and with the exception of a short-lived attempt to recover Sicily under
George Maniakes
, no major naval expeditions were undertaken either. Inevitably, this long period of peace and prosperity led to complacency and neglect of the military. Already in the reign of
Basil II
(976-1025), the defence of the Adriatic was entrusted to the Venetians. Under
Constantine IX
(1042-1055), both the army and navy were reduced as military service was increasingly commuted in favour of cash payments, resulting in an increased dependency upon foreign mercenaries.
[110]
[111]
The large thematic fleets declined and were replaced by small squadrons subject to the local military commanders, geared more towards the suppression of piracy than towards confronting a major maritime foe.
[112]
By the last quarter of the 11th century, the Byzantine navy was a shadow of its former self, having declined through neglect, the incompetence of its officers, and lack of funds.
[113]
Kekaumenos
, writing in c. 1078, laments that "on the pretext of reasonable patrols, [the Byzantine ships] are doing nothing else but ferrying wheat, barley, pulse, cheese, wine, meat, olive oil, a great deal of money, and anything else" from the islands and coasts of the Aegean, while they "flee [the enemy] before they have even caught sight of them, and thus become an embarrassment to the Romans".
[108]
By the time Kekaumenos wrote, new and powerful adversaries had risen. In the West, the
Norman
Kingdom of Sicily
, which had expelled the Byzantines from Southern Italy and had conquered Sicily,
[114]
was now casting its eye on the Byzantine Adriatic coasts and beyond. In the East, the disastrous
Battle of Manzikert
in 1071 had resulted in the loss of Asia Minor, the Empire's military and economic heartland, to the
Seljuk Turks
, who by 1081 had established their capital at
Nicaea
, barely a hundred miles south of Constantinople.
[115]
Soon after, Turkish as well as Christian pirates appeared in the Aegean. The Byzantine thematic fleets, which once policed the seas, were by then so depleted by neglect and the successive civil wars that they were incapable of responding effectively.
[116]
Attempts at recovery under Alexios I and John II
[
edit
]
At this point, the sorry state of the Byzantine fleet had dire consequences. The Norman invasion could not be forestalled, and their army seized Corfu, landed unopposed in Epirus and
laid siege
to
Dyrrhachium
,
[117]
starting a decade of war which consumed the scant resources of the embattled Empire.
[118]
The new emperor,
Alexios I Komnenos
(1081-1118), was forced to call upon the assistance of the Venetians, who in the 1070s had already asserted their control of the Adriatic and Dalmatia against the Normans.
[119]
In 1082, in exchange for their help, he granted them major trading concessions.
[120]
This treaty, and subsequent extensions of these privileges, practically rendered the Byzantines hostage to the Venetians (and later also the Genoese and the Pisans). Historian John Birkenmeier notes that:
Byzantium's lack of a navy [...] meant that Venice could regularly extort economic privileges, determine whether invaders, such as the Normans or Crusaders entered the Empire, and parry any Byzantine attempts to restrict Venetian commercial or naval activity.
[118]
In the clashes with the Normans through the 1080s, the only effective Byzantine naval force was a squadron commanded, and possibly maintained, by
Michael Maurex
, a veteran naval commander of previous decades. Together with the Venetians, he initially prevailed over the Norman fleet, but the joint fleet was caught off guard and defeated by the Normans off Corfu in 1084.
[121]
[122]
Alexios inevitably realized the importance of having his own fleet, and despite his preoccupation with land operations, he took steps to re-establish the navy's strength. His efforts bore some success, especially in countering the attempts by Turkish emirs like
Tzachas
of Smyrna to
launch fleets
in the Aegean.
[123]
[124]
The fleet under
John Doukas
was subsequently used to suppress revolts in Crete and Cyprus.
[125]
With the aid of the
Crusaders
, Alexios was able to regain the coasts of Western Anatolia and expand his influence eastwards: in 1104, a Byzantine squadron of 10 ships captured Laodicea and other coastal towns as far as
Tripoli
.
[126]
By 1118, Alexios was able to pass on a small navy to his successor,
John II Komnenos
(1118-1143).
[127]
Like his father, John II concentrated on the army and regular land-based campaigns, but he took care to maintain the navy's strength and provisioning system.
[124]
In 1122, however, John refused to renew the trading privileges that Alexios had granted to the Venetians. In retaliation, the Venetians plundered several Byzantine islands, and, with the Byzantine fleet unable to confront them, John was forced to renew the treaty in 1125.
[127]
Evidently, the Byzantine navy at this point was not sufficiently powerful for John to successfully confront Venice, especially since there were other pressing demands on the Empire's resources. Not long after this incident, John II, acting on the advice of his finance minister
John of Poutza
, is reported to have cut funding to the fleet and transferred it to the army, equipping ships on an
ad hoc
basis only.
[127]
[128]
Naval expeditions of Manuel I
[
edit
]
The navy enjoyed a major comeback under the ambitious emperor
Manuel I Komnenos
(1143-1180), who used it extensively as a powerful tool of foreign policy in his relations with the Latin and Muslim states of the Eastern Mediterranean.
[129]
During the early years of his reign, the Byzantine naval forces were still weak: in 1147, the fleet of
Roger II of Sicily
under
George of Antioch
was able to raid Corfu, the
Ionian islands
and into the Aegean almost unopposed.
[130]
In the next year, with Venetian aid, an army accompanied by a very large fleet (allegedly 500 warships and 1,000 transports) was sent to recapture Corfu and the Ionian Islands from the Normans. In retaliation, a Norman fleet of 40 ships reached Constantinople itself, demonstrating in the Bosporus off the
Great Palace
and raiding its suburbs.
[131]
[132]
On its return voyage however it was attacked and destroyed by a Byzantine or Venetian fleet.
[132]
In 1155, a Byzantine squadron of 10 ships in support of Norman rebel
Robert III of Loritello
arrived at
Ancona
, launching the last Byzantine bid to regain Southern Italy. Despite initial successes and reinforcements under
megas doux
Alexios Komnenos Bryennios, the expedition was ultimately defeated in 1156, and 4 Byzantine ships were captured.
[133]
By 1169, the efforts of Manuel had evidently borne fruit, as a large and purely Byzantine fleet of about 150
galleys
, 10-12 large transports and 60
horse transports
under
megas doux
Andronikos Kontostephanos
was sent to
invade Egypt
in cooperation with the ruler of the
Crusader
Kingdom of Jerusalem
.
[134]
[135]
The invasion failed, however, and the Byzantines lost half the fleet in a storm on the way back.
[136]
Following the Empire-wide seizure and imprisonment of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet was strong enough to
deter an outright attack
by the Venetians, who sailed to
Chios
and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet.
[137]
It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the humiliation of 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off
Acre
, as Count
Philip of Flanders
and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign.
[136]
[138]
[139]
However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian
Niketas Choniates
attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.
[140]
Decline
[
edit

Angelos dynasty and the Fourth Crusade
[
edit
]
Further information on this period:
Byzantine Empire under the Angelos dynasty
After the death of Manuel I and the subsequent demise of the Komnenian dynasty in 1185, the navy declined swiftly. The maintenance of galleys and the upkeep of proficient crews were very expensive, and neglect led to a rapid deterioration of the fleet. Already by 1182 the Byzantines had to pay Venetian mercenaries to crew some of their galleys,
[141]
but in the 1180s, as the bulk of the Komnenian naval establishment persisted, expeditions of 70-100 ships are still recorded in contemporary sources.
[142]
Thus Emperor
Andronikos I Komnenos
(1183-1185) could still gather 100 warships in 1185 to resist and later defeat a Norman fleet in the
Sea of Marmara
.
[143]
However, the subsequent peace treaty included a clause that required the Normans to furnish a fleet for the Empire. This, together with a similar agreement made by
Isaac II Angelos
(1185-1195 and 1203-1204) with Venice the next year, in which the Republic would provide 40-100 galleys at six months' notice in exchange for favourable trading concessions, is a telling indication that the Byzantine government was aware of the inadequacy of its own naval establishment.
[141]
The
fall of Constantinople
to the Fourth Crusade marked the triumph of the Latin West, and especially the Venetian maritime power, over the enfeebled Byzantine Empire.
The period also saw the rise of piracy across the Eastern Mediterranean. The pirate activity was high in the Aegean, while pirate captains frequently offering themselves as mercenaries to one or the other of the region's powers, providing for the latter a quick and cheap way of raising a fleet for particular expeditions, without the costs of a standing navy. Thus a Byzantine fleet of 66 vessels sent by Isaac II to recapture Cyprus from
Isaac Komnenos
was destroyed by the pirate
Margaritus of Brindisi
, who was in the employ of the Normans of Sicily.
[144]
The depredations of the pirates, especially the
Genoese
captain Kaphoures, described by Niketas Choniates and his brother, the
Metropolitan of Athens
Michael Choniates
, finally forced the Angeloi to action. The fleet tax was once again levied from the coastal regions and a navy of 30 ships was equipped, which was entrusted to the Calabrian pirate
Steiriones
. Despite scoring a few early successes, Steiriones' fleet was destroyed in a surprise attack by Kaphoures off
Sestos
. A second fleet, augmented by Pisan vessels and again commanded by Steiriones, was finally able to defeat Kaphoures and end his raids.
[145]
At the same time, however, the then
megas doux
,
Michael Stryphnos
, was accused by Niketas Choniates of enriching himself by selling off the equipment of the imperial fleet,
[141]
[146]
while by the early 13th century the authority of the central government had weakened to such an extent that various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces.
[147]
The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like
Leo Sgouros
in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos,
Pegonites
, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor
Alexios III Angelos
(1195-1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.
[148]
The Byzantine state and its fleet were thus in no state to resist the naval might of Venice, which supported the
Fourth Crusade
. When Alexios III and Stryphnos were alerted to the fact that the Crusade was sailing for Constantinople, only 20 "wretched and decayed" vessels could be found, according to Niketas Choniates. During the
first Crusader siege
of the city in 1203, the attempts of the Byzantine ships to oppose the Crusader fleet from entering the
Golden Horn
were repulsed, and the Byzantine attempt to employ
fireships
failed due to the Venetians' skill at handling their ships.
[149]
Nicaea and the Palaiologan period
[
edit
]
Further information on this period:
Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty
Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. He restored the Byzantine Empire by recapturing Constantinople, and was responsible for the last flourishing of Byzantium as a major naval power.
After the
capture
of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Byzantine Empire was
partitioned
between the Crusaders, while three Greek successor states were set up, the
Despotate of Epirus
, the
Empire of Trebizond
, and the
Empire of Nicaea
, each claiming the Byzantine imperial title. The former did not maintain a fleet, the Trapezuntine navy was minuscule and mostly used for patrols and transporting troops, while the Nicaeans initially followed a policy of consolidation and used their fleet for coastal defence.
[150]
[151]
Under
John III Vatatzes
(1222-1254), a more energetic foreign policy was pursued, and in 1225, the Nicaean fleet was able to occupy the islands of
Lesbos
, Chios,
Samos
, and
Icaria
.
[152]
It was, however, no match for the Venetians: attempting to
blockade Constantinople
in 1235, the Nicaean navy was defeated by a far smaller Venetian force, and in
another similar attempt
in 1241, the Nicaeans were again routed.
[152]
Nicaean efforts during the 1230s to support a local rebellion in Crete against Venice were also only partially successful, with the last Nicaean troops being forced to leave the island in 1236.
[153]
[154]
Aware of the weakness of his navy, in March 1261 the Emperor
Michael VIII Palaiologos
(1259-1282) concluded the
Treaty of Nymphaeum
with the Genoese, securing their aid against Venice at sea, in return for commercial privileges.
[155]
[156]
Following the recapture of Constantinople a few months later however, Michael VIII was able to focus his attention on building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not able to stand up to Venice in a direct confrontation, as evidenced by the
defeat
of a combined Byzantine-Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263.
[157]
Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing
Venetian-Genoese war
,
[156]
by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 galleys besieged the town of
Oreos
in Negroponte (
Euboea
), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 galleys.
[158]
This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.
[159]
This revival did not last long. Following the death of
Charles of Anjou
in 1285 and the end of the threat of an invasion from Italy, Michael's successor
Andronikos II Palaiologos
(1282-1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was less concerned with the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships are broken up or left to rot.
[160]
[161]
The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation,
[162]
[163]
while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the
1296-1302 war
.
[164]
[165]
Andronikos' decision aroused considerable opposition and criticism from contemporary scholars and officials almost from the outset, and historians like
Pachymeres
and
Nikephoros Gregoras
dwell long on the disastrous long-term effects of this short-sighted decision: piracy flourished, often augmented by the crews of the disbanded fleet who took service under Turkish and Latin masters, Constantinople was rendered defenceless towards the Italian maritime powers, and more and more Aegean islands fell under foreign rule—including Chios to the Genoese
Benedetto Zaccaria
,
Rhodes and the Dodecanese
to the
Hospitallers
, Lesbos and other islands to the
Gattilusi
. As Gregoras commented, "if [the Byzantines] had remained masters of the seas, as they had been, then the Latins would not have grown so arrogant [...], nor would the Turks ever have gazed upon the sands of the [Aegean] sea, [...] nor would we have to pay to everyone tribute every year."
[166]
[167]
[168]
After 1305, bowing to popular pressure and the need to contain the
Catalan Company
, the Emperor belatedly tried to rebuild the navy of 20 vessels, but although a few ships were built and a small fleet appears to have been active over the next couple of years, it eventually was disbanded again.
[169]
[170]
In the 14th century, recurrent civil wars, attacks from Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened the collapse of the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final fall to the
Ottoman Turks
in 1453.
[171]
Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.
[172]
Thus Andronikos II's successor
Andronikos III Palaiologos
(1328-1341), immediately after his accession, with the help of contributions from various magnates, assembled a large fleet of reportedly 105 vessels. This he personally led in the last major foray of a Byzantine navy in the Aegean, recovering Chios and
Phocaea
from the Genoese and forcing various smaller Latin and Turkish principalities to come to terms with him.
[173]
[174]
His campaigns against the Ottomans in
Bithynia
were failures, however, and soon the Ottomans had established their first naval base at
Trigleia
on the Sea of Marmara, from where they raided the coasts of Thrace.
[175]
To defend against this new threat, towards the end of Andronikos III's reign a fleet of some 70 ships was built at Constantinople to oppose the Turkish raids, and headed by the
megas doux
,
Alexios Apokaukos
.
[176]
This fleet was very active during the
civil war of 1341-1347
, in which its commander played a prominent role.
[177]
[178]
Following the civil war, Emperor
John VI Kantakouzenos
(1347-1354) tried to restore the navy and merchant fleet, as a means of both reducing the Empire's economic dependency on the Genoese colony of
Galata
, which controlled the trade passing through Constantinople, and of securing the control of the Dardanelles against passage by the Turks.
[179]
[180]
To that end, he enlisted the aid of the Venetians, but in March 1349, his newly built fleet of nine warships and about 100 smaller vessels were caught in a storm off the southern shore of Constantinople. The inexperienced crews panicked, and the ships were either
sunk or captured
by the Genoese.
[179]
[181]
Undeterred, Kantakouzenos launched another effort at building a fleet, which allowed him to re-establish Byzantine authority over Thessalonica and some coastal cities and islands. A core of this fleet was maintained at Constantinople, and although Byzantine ships remained active in the Aegean, and scored some successes over Turkish pirates, they were never able to stop their activities, let alone challenge the Italian navies for supremacy at sea.
[182]
Lack of funds condemned the fleet to a mere handful of vessels maintained at Constantinople.
[172]
It is characteristic that in his 1418 pamphlet to the
despotes
Theodore II Palaiologos
, the scholar
Gemistos Plethon
advises against the maintenance of a navy, on the grounds that resources were insufficient to adequately maintain both it and an effective army.
[183]
Henceforth, the impoverished Byzantine state became a pawn of the great powers of the day, trying to survive by exploiting their rivalries.
[184]
Thus, for instance, in 1351, Kantakouzenos was induced to side with Venice in its
war with Genoa
, but, abandoned by the Venetian admirals, his fleet was easily defeated by the Genoese and he was forced to sign an unfavourable peace.
[185]
During the brief usurpation of
John VII
in 1390,
Manuel II
(1391-1425) was able to gather only five galleys and four smaller vessels (including some from the Hospitallers of Rhodes) to recapture Constantinople and rescue his father
John V
.
[186]
Six years later, Manuel promised to arm ten ships to assist the
Crusade of Nicopolis
;
[187]
twenty years later, he personally commanded 4 galleys and 2 other vessels carrying some infantry and cavalry, and saved the island of
Thasos
from an invasion.
[188]
Byzantine ships were active throughout the
Ottoman Interregnum
, when Byzantium sided with various rival Ottoman princes in turn. Manuel used his ships to ferry the rival pretenders and their forces across the Straits.
[189]
With Genoese assistance, Manuel's fleet was also able to muster a fleet of eight galleys and capture Gallipoli in May 1410, albeit for a brief time;
[190]
and in August 1411, the Byzantine fleet was instrumental in the failure of a siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman prince
Musa Çelebi
, when it defeated Musa's attempt to blockade the city by sea as well.
[191]
Likewise, in 1421, 10 Byzantine warships were engaged in support of the Ottoman pretender Mustafa against Sultan
Murad II
.
[187]
The last recorded Byzantine naval victory occurred in 1427 in a
battle
off the
Echinades
Islands, when the Emperor
John VIII Palaiologos
(1425-1448) defeated the superior fleet of
Carlo I Tocco
,
Count of Cephalonia
and
Despot of Epirus
, forcing him to relinquish all his holdings in the Morea to the Byzantines.
[192]
The last appearance of the Byzantine navy was in the final Ottoman siege of 1453, when a mixed fleet of Byzantine, Genoese and Venetian ships (varying numbers are provided by the sources, ranging from 10 to 39 vessels) defended Constantinople against the Ottoman fleet.
[193]
[194]
During the siege, on 20 April 1453, the last naval engagement in Byzantine history took place when three Genoese galleys escorting a Byzantine transport fought their way through the huge Ottoman blockade fleet and into the Golden Horn.
[195]
Organization
[
edit
]
Early period (4th - mid-7th centuries)
[
edit
]
Very little is known about the organization of the Roman fleets of late Antiquity, from the gradual break-up of the large provincial fleets into smaller squadrons in the 3rd century to the formation of a new navy at the onset of the Muslim conquests. Despite the evidence of considerable naval activity in this period, earlier scholars believed that the Roman navy had all but vanished by the 4th century, but more recent work has altered this picture towards a transformation into a mainly fluvial and coastal force, designed for close co-operation with the army.
[196]
Under Emperor
Diocletian
(284-305), the navy's strength reportedly increased from 46,000 men to 64,000 men,
[197]
a figure that represents the numerical peak of the late Roman navy. The
Danube
Fleet (
Classis Histrica
) with its attendant legionary flotillas is still well attested in the
Notitia Dignitatum
, and its increased activity is commented upon by
Vegetius
(
De Re Militari
, IV.46). In the West, several fluvial fleets are mentioned, but the old standing praetorian fleets had all but vanished (
De Re Militari
, IV.31) and even the remaining western provincial fleets appear to have been seriously understrength and incapable of countering any significant barbarian attack.
[198]
In the East, the Syrian and Alexandrian fleets are known from legal sources to have still existed in c. 400 (
Codex Justinianus
,
&
), while a fleet is known to have been stationed at Constantinople itself, perhaps created out of the remnants of the praetorian fleets.
[8]
In 400 it was sufficient to slaughter a large number of
Goths
who had built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe.
[199]
Its size, however, is unknown, and it does not appear in the
Notitia
.
[200]
For operations in the Mediterranean during the 5th century, fleets appear to have been assembled on an
ad hoc
basis and then disbanded.
[16]
The first permanent Byzantine fleet can be traced to the early 6th century and the revolt of Vitalian in 513-515, when Anastasius I created a fleet to counter the rebels' own.
[16]
This fleet was retained and under Justinian I and his successors it was developed into a professional and well-maintained force.
[26]
Because of the absence of any naval threat, however, the navy of the late 6th century was relatively small, with several small flotillas in the Danube and two main fleets maintained at Ravenna and Constantinople.
[201]
Additional flotillas must have been stationed at the other great maritime and commercial centres of the Empire: at Alexandria, providing the escort to the annual grain fleet to Constantinople, and at Carthage, controlling the western Mediterranean. Justinian also stationed troops and ships at the more remote outposts of the Empire, at Septem (
Ceuta
),
Cherson
in the
Crimea
, and Aelana (
Eilat
) in the
Gulf of Aqaba
.
[202]
[203]
[204]
The long-established naval tradition and infrastructure of those areas made the maintenance of the fleet easier, and, in the event of a naval expedition, a large fleet could be quickly and inexpensively assembled by impressing the numerous merchant vessels.
[205]
Middle period (late 7th century - 1070s)
[
edit
]
Fleet organization
[
edit
]
The Byzantine Empire between the 6th and late 9th centuries, including the themes as of
c.
900
. The scattered and isolated imperial possessions around the Mediterranean were defended and reinforced by the Byzantine fleets.
In response to the Arab conquests during the 7th century, the whole administrative and military system of the Empire was reformed, and the
thematic system
established. According to this, the Empire was divided into several themes (
Ancient Greek
:
θέματα
,
romanized
:
themata
, sing.
θέμα
,
thema
), which were regional civil and military administrations. Under the command of a
strategos
, each theme maintained its own, locally levied forces. Following a series of revolts by thematic forces, under Constantine V the larger early themes were progressively broken up, while a central imperial army, the
tagmata
, was created, stationed at or near Constantinople, serving as a central reserve that henceforth formed the core of campaigning armies.
[206]
[207]
Rise and fall of the
Karabisianoi
[
edit
]
A similar process was followed in the fleet, which was organized along similar lines. In the second half of the 7th century, the fleet of the
Karabisianoi
(
Ancient Greek
:
Καραβισιάνοι
,
lit.
'the Ships' Men') was created.
[208]
The exact date is unknown, with suggestions ranging from the 650s/660s, in response to the Battle of the Masts,
[33]
[209]
[210]
or following the first Arab siege of Constantinople in 672-678.
[211]
Its origin is also unknown: it was recruited possibly from the remainders of the old
quaestura exercitus
,
[212]
or the army of the
Illyricum
.
[213]
It was headed by a
strategos
(
strategos ton karabon/karabisianon
,
lit.
'general of the ships/seafarers'),
[214]
and included the southern coast of Asia Minor from
Miletus
to the frontier with the
Caliphate
near
Seleucia
in Cilicia, the Aegean islands and the imperial holdings in southern Greece. Its headquarters was initially perhaps at Samos, with a subordinate command under a
droungarios
at Cibyrrha in
Pamphylia
. As its name suggests, it comprised most of the Empire's standing navy, and faced the principal maritime threat, the Arab fleets of Egypt and Syria.
[105]
[212]
The
Karabisianoi
however proved inadequate and were replaced in the early 8th century by a more complex system composed of three elements, which with minor alterations survived until the 11th century: a central imperial fleet based at Constantinople, a small number of large regional naval commands, either naval themes or independent commands termed "droungariates", and a greater number of local squadrons charged with purely defensive and police tasks and subordinate to the local provincial governors.
[215]
Unlike the earlier Roman navy, where the provincial fleets were decidedly inferior in numbers and included only lighter vessels than the central fleets, the Byzantine regional fleets were probably formidable formations in their own right.
[216]
The Imperial Fleet
[
edit
]
The capital's navy had played a central role in the repulsion of the Arab sieges of Constantinople,
[212]
but the exact date of the establishment of the Imperial Fleet (
βασιλικὸς στόλος
,
basilikos stolos
, or
βασιλικὸν πλόϊμον
,
basilikon ploïmon
) as a distinct command is unclear. The Irish historian
J. B. Bury
, followed by the French Byzantinist
Rodolphe Guilland
, considered it "not improbable" that the Imperial Fleet existed as a subordinate command under the
strategos ton karabisianon
already in the 7th century.
[217]
[218]
On the other hand, the
droungarios
of the Imperial Fleet
first appears in the
Taktikon Uspensky
of
c.
842/3
;
[218]
and as there is little evidence for major fleets operating from Constantinople during the 8th century, the Greek Byzantinist
Hélène Ahrweiler
dated the fleet's creation to the early 9th century.
[219]
From that point on, the Imperial Fleet formed the main naval reserve force and provided the core of various expeditionary fleets.
[220]
Maritime themes
[
edit
]
The first and for a long time only maritime theme (
θέμα ναυτικόν
,
thema nautikon
) was the
Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots
(
θέμα Κιβυρραιωτῶν
,
thema Kibyrrhaioton
). It was created from the
Karabisianoi
fleet, and assigned to the administration and defence of the southern coasts of Asia Minor.
[221]
[222]
The exact date of its creation is unclear, with one view proposing
c.
719
[223]
[224]
and another
c.
727
.
[46]
Its
strategos
, first mentioned in 734, was based at
Attaleia
.
[225]
[226]
His principal lieutenants were the
katepano
(head commander) of the Mardaites, an
ek prosopou
(deputy commander) at
Syllaeum
and
droungarioi
of Attaleia and
Kos
.
[226]
[227]
Being located closest to the Muslim Levant, it remained the Empire's principal naval fleet for centuries,
[105]
until it was reduced with the decline of the Arab naval threat. The fleet is last mentioned in 1043, and thereafter the theme became a purely civilian province.
[226]
The Cibyrrhaeots were complemented by two independent naval commands in the Aegean, each headed by a
droungarios
: the
Aigaion Pelagos
('Aegean Sea'), covering the northern half of the Aegean and the Dardanelles and
Marmara Sea
,
[228]
and the command variously known as the
Dodekanesos
('Twelve Islands') and
Kolpos
('Gulf'), which was based at Samos and comprised the southern Aegean including the Cyclades.
[229]
Unlike the other
droungarioi
, who headed subordinate commands, these two circumscriptions were completely independent, and their
droungarioi
exercised both civil and military authority over them.
[230]
Eventually, they were raised to full maritime themes, the
Theme of the Aegean Sea
(
θέμα τοῦ Αἰγαίου Πελάγους
,
thema tou Aigaiou Pelagous
) in
c.
843
,
[58]
[231]
while the eastern parts of the
Dodekanesos
/
Kolpos
droungariate formed the
Theme of Samos
(
θέμα Σάμου
,
thema Samou
) in the late 9th century. It comprised it the
Ionian
coast, and its capital was at
Smyrna
.
[229]
[232]
Local squadrons
[
edit
]
Some of the other, 'land' themes also maintained sizeable squadrons, usually placed under a
tourmarches
(mentioned collectively as
tourmarchai ton ploïmaton
in the
Taktikon Uspensky
). They played an intermediate role between the large thematic fleets and the central Imperial Fleet: they were permanent squadrons with professional crews (
taxatoi
), maintained by resources from the imperial treasury and not the province they were stationed in, but subordinate to the local thematic
strategos
and charged mainly with local defence and police duties.
[233]
These were:
The
Theme of Hellas
(
θέμα Ἑλλάδος
,
thema Hellados
), founded in
c.
686-689
by Justinian II, it encompassed the imperial possessions of southern
Greece
with capital at
Corinth
. Justinian settled 6,500 Mardaites there, who provided oarsmen and garrisons.
[234]
While not exclusively a naval theme, it maintained its own fleet. It was split in 809 into the
Theme of the Peloponnese
and the new Theme of Hellas, covering
Central Greece
and
Thessaly
, which also retained smaller fleets.
[222]
[235]
The
Theme of Sicily
(
θέμα Σικελίας
,
thema Sikelias
) was responsible for
Sicily
and the imperial possessions in south-western Italy (
Calabria
). Once the bastion of Byzantine naval strength in the West, by the late 9th century it had greatly diminished in strength and disappeared after the final loss of Taormina in 902.
[105]
Distinct
tourmarchai
are attested for Sicily proper and Calabria.
[236]
The
Theme of Cephallenia
(
θέμα Κεφαλληνίας
,
thema Kephallenias
), controlling the
Ionian Islands
, was established in the mid- to late 8th century, to protect imperial communications with Italy and defend the
Ionian Sea
from Arab raids. The new imperial possessions in
Apulia
were added to it in the 870s, before they were made into a separate theme (that of
Longobardia
) in about 910.
[237]
The
Theme of Paphlagonia
(
θέμα Παφλαγονίας
,
thema Paphlagonias
) and the
Theme of Chaldia
(
θέμα Χαλδίας
,
thema Chaldias
) were split off from the
Armeniac Theme
in
c.
819
by Emperor
Leo V
and provided with their own naval squadrons, possibly as a defence against Rus' raids.
[238]
Isolated regions of particular importance for the control of the major sea-lanes were covered by separate officials with the title of
archon
, who in some cases may have commanded detachments of the Imperial Fleet. Such
archontes
are known for Chios, Malta, the
Euboic Gulf
, and possibly
Vagenetia
and "Bulgaria" (whose area of control is identified by Ahrweiler with the mouths of the Danube).
[239]
These vanished by the end of the 9th century, either succumbing to Arab attacks or being reformed or incorporated into themes.
[240]
Manpower and size
[
edit
]
Just as with its land counterpart, the exact size of the Byzantine navy and its units is a matter of considerable debate, owing to the scantness and ambiguous nature of the primary sources. One exceptions are the numbers for the late 9th and early 10th century, for which we possess a more detailed breakdown, dated to the Cretan expedition of 911. These lists reveal that during the reign of Leo VI the Wise, the navy reached 34,200 oarsmen and perhaps as many as 8,000 marines.
[3]
The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 oarsmen and 4,000 marines under the command of the
droungarios
of the Imperial Fleet. These four thousand marines were professional soldiers, first recruited as a corps by Basil I in the 870s. They were a great asset to the Imperial Fleet, for whereas previously it had depended on thematic and tagmatic soldiers for its marines, the new force provided a more reliable, better trained and immediately available force at the Emperor's disposal.
[73]
The high status of these marines is illustrated by the fact that they were considered to belong to the imperial
tagmata
, and were organized along similar lines.
[241]
The Aegean thematic fleet numbered 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines, the Cibyrrhaeot fleet stood at 5,710 oarsmen and 1,000 marines, the Samian fleet at 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, and finally, the Theme of Hellas furnished 2,300 oarsmen with a portion of its 2,000 thematic soldiers doubling as marines.
[3]
The following table contains estimates, by Warren T. Treadgold, of the number of oarsmen over the entire history of the Byzantine navy:
Year
300
457

775
842
959
1025

14,600
[245]
34,200
[245]
34,200
[245]
3,080
[246]
Contrary to popular perception,
galley slaves
were not used as oarsmen, either by the Byzantines or the Arabs, or by their Roman and Greek predecessors.
[247]
Throughout the existence of the Empire, Byzantine crews consisted of mostly lower-class freeborn men, who were professional soldiers, legally obliged to perform military service (
strateia
) in return for pay or land estates. In the first half of the 10th century, the latter were calculated to be of the value of 2-3 pounds (0.91-1.36 kg) of gold for sailors and marines.
[248]
[249]
Use was however made of prisoners of war and foreigners as well. Alongside the Mardaites, who formed a significant part of the fleet's crews, an enigmatic group known as the
Toulmatzoi
(possibly Dalmatians) appears in the Cretan expeditions, as well as many Rus', who were given the right to serve in the Byzantine armed forces in a series of 10th-century
treaties
.
[250]
[251]
In his
De Ceremoniis
,
Constantine Porphyrogennetos
gives the fleet lists for the expeditions against Crete of 911 and 949. These references have sparked a considerable debate as to their interpretation: thus the numbers given for the entire Imperial Fleet in 949 can be interpreted as either 100, 150 or 250 ships, depending on the reading of the Greek text. The precise meaning of the term
ousia
(
οὺσία
) is also a subject of confusion: traditionally, it is held to have been a standard complement of 108 men, and that more than one could be present aboard a single ship. In the context of the
De Ceremoniis
however, it can also be read simply as "unit" or "ship".
[252]
[253]
The number of 150 seems more compatible with the numbers recorded elsewhere, and is accepted by most scholars, although they differ as to the composition of the fleet. Makrypoulias interprets the number as 8
pamphyloi
, 100
ousiakoi
and 42
dromones
proper, the latter including the two imperial vessels and the ten ships of the
Stenon
squadron.
[254]
[4]
As for the total size of the Byzantine navy in this period, Warren Treadgold extrapolates a total, including the naval themes, of
c.
240
warships, a number which was increased to 307 for the Cretan expedition of 960-961. According to Treadgold, the latter number probably represents the approximate standing strength of the entire Byzantine navy (including the smaller flotillas) in the 9th and 10th centuries.
[4]
It is however noteworthy that a significant drop in the numbers of ships and men attached to the thematic fleets is evident between 911 and 949. This drop, which reduced the size of thematic fleets from a third to a quarter of the total navy, was partly due to the increased use of the lighter
ousiakos
type instead of the heavier
dromon
proper, and partly due to financial and manpower difficulties. It is also indicative of a general trend that would lead to the complete disappearance of the provincial fleets by the late 11th century.
[255]
Rank structure
[
edit
]
Although naval themes were organized much the same way as their land counterparts, there is some confusion in the Byzantine sources as to the exact rank structure.
[256]
The usual term for admiral was
strategos
, the same term used for the generals that governed the land themes. Under the
strategos
were two or three
tourmarchai
(sing.
tourmarches
, effectively 'vice admiral'), in turn overseeing a number of
droungarioi
(sing.
droungarios
, corresponding to 'rear admiral').
[257]
Until the mid-9th century, the governors of the themes of the Aegean and Samos are also recorded as
droungarioi
, since their commands were split off from the original
Karabisianoi
fleet, but they were then raised to the rank of
strategos
.
[257]
As the thematic admirals also doubled as governors of their themes, they were assisted by a
protonotarios
(chief secretary) who headed the civilian administration of the theme. Further staff officers were the
chartoularios
in charge of the fleet administration, the
protomandator
(chief messenger), who acted as chief of staff, and a number of staff
kometes
('counts', sing.
komes
), including a
komes tes hetaireias
, who commanded the bodyguard (
hetaireia
) of the admiral.
[258]
Seal of Niketas,
magistros
,
droungarios
and
katepano
of the
basilikon ploïmon
(late 9th century)
The Imperial Fleet was a different case, as it was not tied to the thematic administration, but was considered as one of the
tagmata
, the professional central reserve forces.
[259]
Consequently, the commander of the Imperial Fleet remained known as the
droungarios tou basilikou ploïmou
(later with the prefix
megas
, 'grand').
[260]
Originally very lowly ranked, the office rose quickly in the hierarchy: by 899 he was placed immediately before or after the
logothetes tou dromou
, and ahead of various senior military and civil officials. He was also notable in not being classed with the other military commanders, whether of the themes or of the
tagmata
, but in the special class of military officials, the
stratarchai
, where he is listed second after the
hetaireiarches
, the commander of the imperial bodyguard.
[261]
[262]
His title is still found in the Komnenian era, albeit as commander of the imperial escort squadron, and survived until the Palaiologan era, being listed in the 14th-century
Book of Offices
of
Pseudo-Kodinos
.
[263]
The office of a deputy called
topoteretes
is also mentioned for the Imperial Fleet, but his role is unclear from the sources. He may have held a post similar to that of a
port admiral
.
[264]
Although some of these senior officers were professional seamen, having risen from the ranks, most fleet commanders were high court officials, who would have relied on their more experienced professional subordinates for nautical expertise.
[265]
In the lower levels of organization, there was more uniformity: squadrons of three or five ships were commanded by a
komes
or
droungarokomes
, and each ship's captain was called
kentarchos
('centurion'), although literary sources also used more archaic terms like
nauarchos
or even
trierarchos
.
[266]
Each ship's crew, depending on its size, was composed of one to three
ousiai
. Under the captain, there was the
bandophoros
('banner bearer'), who acted as executive officer, two
protokaraboi
(sing.
protokarabos
, 'first ship-man'), sometimes also referred to archaically as
kybernetes
, and a bow officer, the
proreus
.
[267]
The
protokaraboi
were helmsmen, in charge of the steering oars in the stern, as well as of the rowers on either side of the ship. The senior of the two was the "first
protokarabos
(
protos protokarabos
).
[268]
In actual terms, there probably were several of each kind of officer upon each ship, working in shifts.
[269]
Most of these officers rose from the ranks, and there are references in the
De Administrando Imperio
to first oarsmen (
protelatai
) who rose to become
protokaraboi
in the imperial barges, and later assumed still higher offices; Emperor Romanos Lekapenos being the most successful example.
[270]
There were also a number of specialists on board, such as the two bow oarsmen and the
siphonatores
, who worked the siphons used for discharging the Greek fire.
[267]
A
boukinator
(trumpeter) is also recorded in the sources,
[271]
who conveyed orders to the rowers (
koplatai

Reforms of the Komnenoi
[
edit
]
After the decline of the navy in the 11th century, Alexios I rebuilt it on different lines. Since the thematic fleets had all but vanished, their remnants were amalgamated into a unified imperial fleet, under the new office of the
megas doux
. The first known occupant of the office was Alexios' brother-in-law John Doukas, in
c.
1092
. The
megas droungarios tou ploïmou
, once the overall naval commander, was subordinated to him, acting now as his principal aide.
[124]
[273]
The
megas doux
was also appointed as overall governor of southern Greece, the old themes of Hellas and the Peloponnese, which were divided into districts (
oria
) that supplied the fleet.
[274]
[275]
Under John II, the Aegean islands also became responsible for the maintenance, crewing and provision of warships, and contemporary sources took pride in the fact that the great fleets of Manuel's reign were crewed by "native Romans", although use continued to be made of mercenaries and allied squadrons.
[124]
[276]
However, the fact that the fleet was now exclusively built and based around Constantinople, and that provincial fleets were not reconstituted, did have its drawbacks, as outlying areas, in particular Greece, were left vulnerable to attack.
[277]
Nicaean navy
[
edit
]
With the decline of the Byzantine fleet in the latter 12th century, the Empire increasingly relied on the fleets of Venice and Genoa. Following the sack of 1204 however, sources suggest the presence of a relatively strong fleet already under the first Nicaean emperor,
Theodore I Laskaris
, although specific details are lacking. Under John III and
Theodore II
(
r.
1254-1258
), the navy had two main strategic areas of operations: the Aegean, entailing operations against the Greek islands (chiefly
Rhodes
) as well as the transport and supply of armies fighting in the Balkans, and the Sea of Marmara, where the Nicaeans aimed to interdict Latin shipping and threaten Constantinople. Smyrna provided the main shipyard and base for the Aegean, with a secondary one at
Stadeia
, while the main base for operations in the Marmara Sea was Holkos, near
Lampsakos
across the
Gallipoli peninsula
.
[278]
Palaiologan navy
[
edit
]
Despite their efforts, the Nicaean emperors failed to successfully challenge the Venetian domination of the seas, and were forced to turn to the Genoese for aid.
[279]
[155]
After regaining Constantinople in 1261 however, Michael VIII initiated a great effort to lessen this dependence by building a "national" navy, forming a number of new corps to this purpose: the
Gasmouloi
(
Γασμοῦλοι
), who were men of mixed Greek-Latin descent living around the capital; and men from
Laconia
, called
Lakones
) or
Tzakones
(
Τζάκωνες
), were used as marines, forming the bulk of Byzantine naval manpower in the 1260s and 1270s.
[280]
[281]
[282]
Michael also set the rowers, called
Prosalentai
(
Προσαλενταί
) or
Proselontes
(
Προσελῶντες
), apart as a separate corps.
[283]
All these groups received small grants of land to cultivate in exchange for their service, and were settled together in small colonies.
[284]
The
Prosalentai
were settled near the sea throughout the northern Aegean,
[285]
while the
Gasmouloi
and
Tzakones
were settled mostly around Constantinople and in
Thrace
. These corps remained extant, albeit in a diminished form, throughout the last centuries of the Empire; indeed the
Gasmouloi
of Gallipoli formed the bulk of the crews of the first Ottoman fleets after the Ottomans captured the area.
[280]
Throughout the Palaiologan period, the fleet's main base was the harbour of
Kontoskalion
on the Marmara shore of Constantinople, dredged and refortified by Michael VIII.
[282]
Among the provincial naval centres, probably the most important was
Monemvasia
in the Peloponnese.
[286]
At the same time, Michael and his successors continued the well-established practice of using foreigners in the fleet. Alongside the mistrusted Italian city-states, with whom alliances shifted regularly, mercenaries were increasingly employed in the last centuries of the Empire, often rewarded for their services with
fiefs
. Most of these mercenaries, like
Giovanni de lo Cavo
(lord of
Anafi
and Rhodes),
Andrea Morisco
(successor of de lo Cavo in Rhodes) and Benedetto Zaccaria (lord of Chios and Phocaea), were Genoese, the Byzantines' major ally in the period. Under Michael VIII, for the first time a foreigner, the Italian privateer
Licario
, became
megas doux
and was given Euboea as a fief.
[287]
[288]
In 1303, another high rank, that of
amerales
(
ἀμηράλης
or
ἀμηραλῆς
) was introduced. The term had already entered Byzantine usage through contact with the Kingdom of Naples and other Western nations, but was rarely used; it was adopted as part of the imperial hierarchy, coming after the
megas doux
and the
megas droungarios
, with the arrival of the mercenaries of the Catalan Company. Only two holders are known,
Ferran d'Aunés
and Andrea Morisco, both from 1303 to 1305, although the rank continued to be mentioned in various lists of offices long after that.
[289]
Thus, according to the mid-14th century
Book of Offices
, the subordinates of the
megas doux
were the
megas droungarios tou stolou
, the
ameralios
, the
protokomes
, the junior
droungarioi
, and the junior
kometes
.
[290]
[1]
Pseudo-Kodinos also records that, while the other warships flew "the usual imperial flag" (
βασιλικὸν φλάμουλον
,
basilikon phlamoulon
) of the
cross and the firesteels
, the
megas doux
flew an image of the emperor on horseback as his distinctive ensign.

Ships
[

Dromons and their derivatives
[
edit
]
Further information:
Dromon
The primary warship of the Byzantine navy until the 12th century was the
dromon
and other similar ship types. Apparently an evolution of the light
liburnian galleys
of the imperial Roman fleets, the term first appears in the late 5th century, and was commonly used for a specific kind of war-galley by the 6th.
[291]
The term
dromon
(
δρόμων
) itself comes from the Greek root
δρομ-(άω)
,
lit.
'to run', thus meaning 'runner'; 6th-century authors like
Procopius
are explicit in their references to the speed of these vessels.
[292]
During the next few centuries, as the naval struggle with the Arabs intensified, heavier versions with two or possibly even three banks of oars evolved.
[293]
Eventually, the term was used in the general sense of 'warship', and was often used interchangeably with another Byzantine term for a large warship,
chelandion
(
χελάνδιον
, from the Greek word
keles
, '
courser
'), which first appeared during the 8th century.
[294]
Evolution and features
[
edit
]
The appearance and evolution of medieval warships is a matter of debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to be gathered by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions and the remains of a few merchant vessels. Only in 2005-2006 did archaeological digs for the
Marmaray
project in the location of the
Harbour of Theodosius
(modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the
galea
type.
[295]
The accepted view is that the main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full
deck
(
katastrōma
), the abandonment of the
rams
on the bow in favour of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of
lateen
sails.
[296]
The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram (
Latin
:
rostrum
;
ἔμβολος
,
embolos
) are unclear. Depictions of upward-pointing beaks in the 4th-century
Vatican Vergil
manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late antique galleys.
[297]
One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient
shell-first
mortise and tenon
hull
construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks.
[298]
Certainly by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten, if we judge by
Isidore of Seville
's comments that they were used to protect against collision with underwater rocks.
[299]
As for the lateen sail, various authors have in the past suggested that it was introduced into the Mediterranean by the Arabs, possibly with an ultimate origin in
India
. However, the discovery of new depictions and literary references in recent decades has led scholars to antedate the appearance of the lateen sail in the Levant to the late
Hellenistic
or early Roman period.
[300]
[301]
[302]
[303]
Not only the triangular, but also the quadrilateral version were known, used for centuries (mostly on smaller craft) in parallel with square sails.
[300]
[304]
Belisarius' invasion fleet of 533 was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon,
[305]
with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation.
[304]
The dromons that Procopius describes were single-banked ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side.
[306]
Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an
outrigger
(
parexeiresia
), these extended directly from the hull.
[307]
In the later
bireme
dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (
elasiai
) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations.
[308]
Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers.
[309]
The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters.
[310]
Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (
histos
or
katartion
), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively,
[311]
assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions.
[312]
The ship was steered by means of two
quarter rudders
at the
stern
(
prymne
), which also housed a tent (
skene
) that covered the captain's berth (
krab[b]at[t]os
).
[313]
The prow (
prora
) featured an elevated forecastle (
pseudopation
), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected,
[314]
although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side.
[315]
A pavesade (
kastelloma
), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around the sides of the ship, providing protection to the deck crew.
[316]
Larger ships also had wooden castles (
xylokastra
) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms.
[317]
The bow spur (
peronion
) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.
[318]
The four
galeai
ships uncovered in the Yenikapi excavations, dating to the 10th-11th centuries, are of uniform design and construction, suggesting a centralized manufacturing process. They have a length of
c.
30
m, and are built of
European Black Pine
and
Oriental plane
.

Ship types

Depiction of a sea battle, from a 13th-century copy of
Oppian
's
Cynegetica
By the 10th century, there were three main classes of bireme (two oar-banks) warships of the general dromon type, as detailed in the inventories for the Cretan expeditions of 911 and 949: the
[chelandion] ousiakon
(
[χελάνδιον] οὑσιακόν
), so named because it was manned by an
ousia
of 108; the
[chelandion] pamphylon
([χελάνδιον] πάμφυλον), crewed with up to 120-160 men, its name either implying an origin in the region of Pamphylia as a transport ship or its crewing with "picked crews" (from
πᾶν+φῦλον
, 'all tribes'); and the
dromon
proper, crewed by two
ousiai
.
[320]
[321]
In the
De Ceremoniis
, the heavy
dromon
is said to have an even larger crew of 230 rowers and 70 marines; naval historian John H. Pryor considers them as supernumerary crews being carried aboard, while the Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests that the extra men correspond to a second rower on each of the upper-bank oars.
[322]
[323]
A smaller, single-bank ship, the
moneres
(
μονήρης
, 'single-banked') or
galea
(
γαλέα
, from which the term 'galley' derives), with
c.
60
men as crew, was used for scouting missions but also in the wings of the battle line.
[324]
The
galea
in particular seems to have been strongly associated with the Mardaites, and Christos Makrypoulias even suggests that the ship was exclusively used by them.
[325]
Three-banked ('trireme') dromons are described in a 9th-century work dedicated to the
parakoimomenos
Basil Lekapenos
. However, this treatise, which survives only in fragments, draws heavily upon references on the appearance and construction of a Classical
trireme
, and must therefore be used with care when trying to apply it to the warships of the middle Byzantine period.
[326]
[327]
The existence of trireme vessels is, however, attested in the Fatimid navy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and references made by Leo VI to large Arab ships in the 10th century may also indicate trireme galleys.
[328]
For cargo transport, the Byzantines usually commandeered ordinary merchantmen as transport ships (
phortegoi
) or supply ships (
skeuophora
). These appear to have been mostly sailing vessels, rather than oared.
[329]
The Byzantines and Arabs also employed
horse-transports
(
hippagoga
), which were either sailing ships or galleys, the latter certainly modified to accommodate the horses.
[330]
Given that the
chelandia
appear originally to have been oared horse-transports, this would imply differences in construction between the
chelandion
and the
dromon
proper, terms which otherwise are often used indiscriminately in literary sources. While the
dromon
was developed exclusively as a war galley, the
chelandion
would have had to have a special compartment amidships to accommodate a row of horses, increasing its
beam
and
hold
depth.
[331]
In addition, Byzantine sources refer to the
sandalos
or
sandalion
(
σάνδαλος
,
σανδάλιον
), which was a boat carried along by the bigger ships. The kind described in the
De Ceremoniis
had a single mast, four oars and a rudder.
[332]
In the earlier years of the empire, shipbuilding wood for transport and supply ships was mainly from
conifers
, but in the later years  from
broad-leaved trees
, possibly from forests in what is now Turkey.
[333]
Western designs of the last centuries
[
edit
]
14th-century painting of a light
galley
, from an icon now at the
Byzantine and Christian Museum
at
Athens
The exact period when the dromon was superseded by
galea
-derived ships of Italian origin is uncertain. The term
dromon
continued in use until the late 12th century, although Byzantine writers were indiscriminate in their use of it.
[334]
Contemporary Western writers used the term to denote large ships, usually transports, and there is evidence to support the idea that this usage had also spread to the Byzantines.
[335]
William of Tyre
's description of the Byzantine fleet in 1169, where "dromons" are classed as very large transports, and the warships with two oar banks are set apart from them, may thus indeed indicate the adoption of the new bireme galley types by the Byzantines.
[336]
From the 13th century on, the term
dromon
fell into gradual disuse and was replaced by
katergon
(
κάτεργον
, meaning 'detailed to/owing a service'), a late-11th century term which originally applied to the crews, who were drawn from populations detailed to military service.
[337]
During the latter period of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantine ships were based on Western models: the term
katergon
is used indiscriminately for both Byzantine and Latin ships, and the horse-carrying
chelandion
was replaced by the Western
taride
(itself deriving from Arabic
tarrida
, adopted as
tareta
,
ταρέτα
, in Greek).
[338]
A similar process is seen in surviving sources from
Angevin
Sicily, where the term
lang
was replaced by the
taride
, although for a time both continued to be used. No construction differences are mentioned between the two, with both terms referring to horse-carrying vessels (
usserii
) capable of carrying from 20 to 40 horses.
[339]
The bireme Italian-style galleys remained the mainstay of Mediterranean fleets until the late 13th century, although again, contemporary descriptions provide little detail on their construction.
[340]
From that point on, the galleys universally became trireme ships, i.e. with three men on a single bank located above deck, each rowing a different oar; the so-called
alla sensile
system.
[341]
[342]
The Venetians also developed the so-called "
great galley
[
it
]
", which was an enlarged galley capable of carrying more cargo for trade.
[343]
Little is known on particular Byzantine ships during the period. The accounts of the 1437 journey by sea of the Byzantine delegation to the
Council of Florence
, by the Byzantine cleric Sylvester Syropoulos and the Greek-Venetian captain Michael of Rhodes, mention that most of the ships were Venetian or Papal, but also record that Emperor John VIII travelled on an "imperial ship". It is unclear whether that ship was Byzantine or had been hired, and its type is not mentioned. It is, however, recorded as having been faster than the Venetian great merchant galleys accompanying it, possibly indicating that it was a light war galley.
[344]
Michael of Rhodes also wrote a treatise on shipbuilding, which provided construction instructions and illustrations of the main vessels, both
and
, used by Venice and the other maritime states of the region in the first half of the 15th century.
Tactics and weapons
[
edit
]
The Byzantines took care to codify, preserve and pass on the lessons of warfare at land and sea from past experience, through the use of
military manuals
. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form the basis of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (
peri naumachias
) in the
Tactica
of Leo the Wise and
Nikephoros Ouranos
(both drawing extensively from the
Naumachiai
of
Syrianos Magistros
and other earlier works),
[326]
complemented by relevant passages in the
De Administrando Imperio
of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.
[29]
Naval strategy, logistics and tactics
[
edit
]
When examining ancient and medieval naval operations, it is necessary to first understand the technological limitations of galley fleets. Galleys did not handle well in rough waters and could be swamped by waves, which would be catastrophic in the open sea; history is replete with instances where galley fleets were sunk by bad weather (e.g. the Roman losses during the
First Punic War
).
[345]
The sailing season was therefore usually restricted from mid-spring to September.
[346]
The maintainable cruising speed of a galley, even when using sails, was limited, as were the amount of supplies it could carry.
[347]
Water in particular, being essentially a galley's "fuel" supply, was of critical importance. There is no evidence that the navy operated dedicated supply ships to support the warships.
[348]
With consumption levels estimated at 8 litres a day for every oarsman, its availability was a decisive operational factor in the often water-scarce and sun-baked coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean.
[349]
Smaller dromons are estimated to have been able to carry about four days' worth of water.
[350]
Effectively, this meant that fleets composed of galleys were confined to coastal routes,
[345]
and had to make frequent landfall to replenish their supplies and rest their crews.
[351]
This is well attested in Byzantine overseas endeavours, from Belisarius' campaign against the Vandals to the Cretan expeditions of the 9th and 10th centuries. It is for these reasons that Nikephoros Ouranos emphasizes the need to have available "men with accurate knowledge and experience of the sea [...], which winds cause it to swell and which blow from the land. They should know both the hidden rocks in the sea, and the places which have no depth, and the land along which one sails and the islands adjacent to it, the harbours and the distance such harbours are the one from the other. They should know both the countries and the water supplies."
[350]
Medieval Mediterranean naval warfare was therefore essentially coastal and amphibious in nature, carried out to seize coastal territory or islands, and not to exercise "
sea control
" as it is understood today.
[352]
Furthermore, following the abandonment of the ram, the only truly "ship-killing" weapon available prior to the advent of gunpowder and explosive shells,
[353]
sea combat became, in the words of John Pryor, "more unpredictable. No longer could any power hope to have such an advantage in weaponry or the skill of crews that success could be expected."
[354]
It is no surprise therefore that the Byzantine and Arab manuals emphasize cautious tactics, with the priority given to the preservation of one's own fleet, and the acquisition of accurate intelligence, often through the use of spies posing as merchants. Emphasis was placed on achieving tactical surprise and, conversely, on avoiding being caught unprepared by the enemy. Ideally, battle was to be given only when assured of superiority by virtue of numbers or tactical disposition.
[355]
[356]
Importance is also laid on matching one's forces and tactics to the prospective enemy: Leo VI, for instance, contrasted (
Tactica
, XIX.74-77) the Arabs with their heavy and slow ships (
koumbaria
), to the small and fast craft (
akatia
, chiefly monoxyla), of the Slavs and Rus'.
[357]
On campaign, following the assembly of the various squadrons at fortified bases (
aplekta
) along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and the baggage train (
touldon
) of sailing vessels and oared transports, which would be sent away in the event of battle.
[358]
The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were transmitted from ship to ship through signal flags (
kamelaukia
) and lanterns.
[359]
The navy played key role in supplying land-based forces.
[102]
The Byzantine fleet repels the Rus' attack on Constantinople in 941. Boarding actions and hand-to-hand fighting determined the outcome of most naval battles in the Middle Ages. Here the Byzantine dromons are shown rolling over the Rus' vessels and smashing their oars with their spurs.
[360]
On the approach to and during an actual battle, a well-ordered formation was critical: if a fleet fell into disorder, its ships would be unable to lend support to each other and probably would be defeated.
[361]
Fleets that failed to keep an ordered formation or that could not order themselves into an appropriate counter-formation (
antiparataxis
) to match that of the enemy, often avoided, or broke off from battle.
[362]
[363]
Tactical manoeuvres were therefore intended to disrupt the enemy formation,
[362]
including the use of various
stratagems
, such as dividing one's force and carrying out flanking manoeuvres, feigning retreat or hiding a reserve in ambush (
Tactica
, XIX.52-56).
[364]
Indeed, Leo VI openly advised (
Tactica
, XIX.36) against direct confrontation and advocates the use of stratagems instead.
[365]
According to Leo VI (
Tactica
, XIX.52), a crescent formation seems to have been the norm, with the flagship in the centre and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks.
[366]
A range of variants and other tactics and counter-tactics was available, depending on the circumstances.
[29]
Once the fleets were close enough, exchanges of missiles began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the
boarding actions
, which decided the outcome.
[367]
Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.
[368]
Armament
[
edit
]
Greek fire
grenades
and
caltrops
from Crete, dated to the 10th and 12th centuries
Unlike the warships of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and the primary means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, as well as the use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire.
[216]
Despite the fearsome reputation of the latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship weapon that the ram had been in the hands of experienced crews.
[369]
Like their Roman predecessors, Byzantine and Muslim ships were equipped with small
catapults
(
mangana
) and
ballistae
(
toxoballistrai
) that launched stones, arrows, javelins, pots of Greek fire or other incendiary liquids,
caltrops
(
triboloi
) and even containers full of
lime
to choke the enemy or, as Emperor Leo VI suggests, scorpions and snakes (
Tactica
, XIX.61-65).
[370]
Marines and the upper-bank oarsmen were heavily armoured in preparation for battle (Leo referred to them as "cataphracts") and armed with close-combat arms such as lances and swords, while the other sailors wore padded felt jackets (
neurika
) for protection and fought with bows and crossbows.
[371]
The importance and volume of missile fire during sea combat can be gauged from the fleet manifests for the Cretan expeditions of the 10th century, which mention 10,000 caltrops, 50 bows and 10,000 arrows, 20 hand-carried
ballistrai
with 200 bolts
myai
, 'flies') and 100 javelins per dromon.
[372]
From the 12th century on, the
crossbow
(called
τζᾶγγρα
,
tzangra
in Greek) became increasingly important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until the advent of fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery.
[373]
The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles.
[374]
Cannons
were introduced in the latter half of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the
land walls
of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.
[375]
Greek fire
[
edit
]
Further information:
Greek fire
Depiction of the use of Greek fire in the
Madrid Skylitzes manuscript
"Greek fire" was the name given by Western Europeans to the flammable concoction used by the Byzantines, so called because the Europeans viewed the Byzantines as
Greeks
instead of
Romans
. The Byzantines themselves used various descriptive names for it, but the most common was 'liquid fire' (
ὑγρόν πῦρ
). Although the use of incendiary chemicals by the Byzantines has been attested to since the early 6th century, the actual substance known as Greek fire is believed to have been created in 673 and is attributed to an engineer from Syria, named Kallinikos.
[376]
The most common method of deployment was to emit the formula through a large bronze tube (
siphon
) onto enemy ships.
[216]
Alternatively, it could be launched in jars fired from catapults; pivoting
cranes
(
gerania
) are also mentioned as a method of pouring combustibles onto enemy ships.
[377]
Usually the mixture would be stored in heated, pressurized barrels and projected through the tube by some sort of pump while the operators were sheltered behind large iron shields. A portable version (
cheirosiphon
) also existed, reputedly invented by Leo VI, making it the direct analogue to a modern
flamethrower
.
[378]
The means of its production was kept a state secret, and its components are only roughly guessed or described through secondary sources like
Anna Komnene
, so that its exact composition remains to this day unknown. In its effect, the Greek fire must have been rather similar to
napalm

Contemporary sources make clear that it could not be extinguished by water, but rather floated and burned on top of it; sand could extinguish it by depriving it of oxygen, and several authors also mention strong vinegar and old urine as being able to extinguish it, presumably by some sort of chemical reaction. Consequently, felt or hides soaked in vinegar were used to provide protection against it.
[379]
"As he [the Emperor] knew that the
Pisans
were skilled in sea warfare and dreaded a battle with them, on the prow of each ship he had a head fixed of a lion or other land-animal, made in brass or iron with the mouth open and then gilded over, so that their mere aspect was terrifying. And the fire which was to be directed against the enemy through tubes he made to pass through the mouths of the beasts, so that it seemed as if the lions and the other similar monsters were vomiting the fire."

Alexiad

Anna Komnene

Despite the somewhat exaggerated accounts of Byzantine writers, it was by no means a "wonder weapon", and did not avert some serious defeats.
[381]
[382]
Given its limited range, and the need for a calm sea and favourable wind conditions, its usability was limited.
[383]
Nevertheless, in favourable circumstances and against an unprepared enemy, its great destructive ability and psychological impact could prove decisive, as displayed repeatedly against the Rus'. Greek fire continued to be mentioned during the 12th century, but the Byzantines failed to use it against the Fourth Crusade, possibly because they had lost access to the areas (the
Caucasus
and the eastern coast of the Black Sea) where the primary ingredients were to be found.
[384]
The Arabs fielded their own 'liquid fire' after 835, but it is unknown if they used the Byzantine formula, possibly obtained through espionage or through the defection of
strategos
Euphemios in 827, or whether they independently created a version of their own.
[216]
A 12th-century treatise prepared by
Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi
for
Saladin
records a version of Greek fire, called
naft
(
naphtha
), which had a
petroleum
base, with sulphur and various resins added.
[385]
Role of the navy in Byzantine history
[
edit
]
It is not easy to assess the importance of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little
hinterland
. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea.
[386]
Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were an essential part of the Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.
[387]
On the other hand, the nature and limitations of the maritime technology of the age meant that the neither the Byzantines nor any of their opponents could develop a true
thalassocracy
.
[388]
Galley fleets were confined to coastal operations, and were not able to play a truly independent role. Furthermore, as the alternation of Byzantine victories and defeats against the Arabs illustrates, no side was able to permanently gain the upper hand. Although the Byzantines pulled off a number of spectacular successes, such as Nasar's remarkable night-time victory in 880 (one of a handful of similar engagements in the Middle Ages), these victories were balanced off by similarly disastrous losses.
[389]
Reports of mutinies by oarsmen in Byzantine fleets also reveal that conditions were often far from the ideal prescribed in the manuals.
[390]
Combined with the traditional predominance of the great
Anatolian
land-holders in the higher
military and civil offices
, all this meant that, as in the Roman Empire, the navy, even at its height, was still regarded largely as an adjunct to the land forces. This fact is clearly illustrated by the relatively lowly positions its admirals held in the imperial hierarchy.
[391]
[392]
It is clear nevertheless that the gradual decline of the indigenous Byzantine naval power in the 10th and 11th centuries, when it was eclipsed by the Italian city-states, chiefly Venice and later Genoa, was of great long-term significance for the fate of the Empire. The sack of the Fourth Crusade, which shattered the foundations of the Byzantine state, was due in large part to the absolute defencelessness of the Empire at sea.
[393]
This process was initiated by Byzantium itself in the 9th century, when the Italians were increasingly employed by the Empire to compensate for its own naval weakness in the West. The Italian republics also profited from their role as intermediaries in the trade between the Empire and Western Europe, marginalizing the Byzantine merchant marine, which in turn had adverse effects on the availability of Byzantine naval forces.
[394]
Inevitably however, as the Italian republics slowly moved away from the Byzantine orbit, they began pursuing their own policies, and from the late 11th century on, they turned from protection of the Empire to exploitation and sometimes outright plunder, heralding the eventual financial and political subjugation of Byzantium to their interests.
[395]
The absence of a strong navy was certainly keenly felt by the Byzantines at the time, as the comments of Kekaumenos illustrate. Strong and energetic emperors like Manuel Komnenos, and later Michael VIII Palaiologos, could revive Byzantine naval power, but even after landing heavy strokes against the Venetians, they merely replaced them with the Genoese and the Pisans. Trade thus remained in Latin hands, its profits continued to be siphoned off from the Empire, and after their deaths, their achievements quickly evaporated.
[277]
After 1204, and with the brief exception of Michael VIII's reign, the fortunes of the now small Byzantine navy were more or less tied to the shifting alliances with the Italian maritime republics.
[396]
When viewing the entire course of Byzantine history, the waxing and waning of the navy's strength closely mirrors the fluctuation of the Empire's fortunes. It is this apparent interrelation that led the French Byzantinist
Louis Bréhier
to remark: "The epochs of [Byzantium's] dominion are those in which it held control of the sea, and it was when it lost it, that its reverses began."

Areas of the world that were part of the British Empire with current
British Overseas Territories
underlined in red. Mandates and protected states are shown in a lighter shade.
The
British Empire
comprised the
dominions
,
colonies
,
protectorates
,
mandates
, and other
territories
ruled or administered by the
United Kingdom
and its predecessor states. It began with the
overseas possessions
and
trading posts
established by
England
in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. 
At its height in the 19th and early 20th century, it was the
largest empire in history
and, for a century, was the foremost global power.
[1]
By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people,
23 per cent of the world population at the time,
[2]
and by 1920, it covered 35.5 million km
2
(13.7 million sq mi),
[3]
24 per cent of the Earth's total land area. As a result,
its constitutional
,
legal
,
linguistic
, and
cultural
legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was described as "
the empire on which the sun never sets
", as the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.
[4]
During the
Age of Discovery
in the 15th and 16th centuries,
Portugal
and
Spain
pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated,
[5]
England,
France
, and the
Netherlands
began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the
Americas
and
Asia
. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (
Britain
, following the
1707 Act of Union
with Scotland) the dominant
colonial power
in
North America
. Britain became the dominant power in the
Indian subcontinent
after the
East India Company
's
conquest
of
Mughal Bengal
at the
Battle of Plassey
in 1757.
The
American War of Independence
resulted in Britain losing some of its oldest and most populous colonies in North America by 1783. While retaining control of
British North America
(now
Canada
) and territories in and near the
Caribbean
in the
British West Indies
, British colonial expansion turned towards Asia,
Africa
, and the
Pacific
. After the defeat of France in the
Napoleonic Wars
(1803-1815), Britain emerged as the principal
naval
and imperial power of the 19th century and expanded its imperial holdings. It pursued trade concessions in China and Japan, and territory in
Southeast Asia
. The "
Great Game
" and "
Scramble for Africa
" also ensued. The period of relative peace (1815-1914) during which the British Empire became the global
hegemon
was later described as
Pax Britannica
(Latin for "British Peace"). Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its colonies, its dominance of much of world trade, and of its oceans, meant that it effectively
controlled the economies of, and readily enforced its interests in, many regions
, such as Asia and
Latin America
.
[6]
[7]
It also came to dominate the
Middle East
. Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white
settler colonies
, some of which were formally reclassified as
Dominions
by the 1920s. By the start of the 20th century,
Germany
and the
United States
had begun to challenge Britain's economic lead. Military, economic and colonial tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the
First World War
, during which Britain relied heavily on its empire. The conflict placed enormous strain on its military, financial, and manpower resources. Although the empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the First World War, Britain was no longer the world's preeminent industrial or military power.
In the
Second World War
, Britain's colonies in
East Asia
and
Southeast Asia
were occupied by the
Empire of Japan
. Despite the final victory of Britain and
its allies
, the damage to British prestige and economy helped accelerate the decline of the empire.
India
, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved
independence
in 1947 as part of a larger
decolonisation
movement, in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire. The
Suez Crisis
of 1956 confirmed Britain's decline as a global power, and the
transfer of Hong Kong to China
on 1 July 1997 symbolised for many the end of the British Empire,
[8]
[9]
though fourteen
overseas territories
that are remnants of the empire remain under British sovereignty. After independence, many former British colonies, along with most of the dominions, joined the
Commonwealth of Nations
, a free association of independent states. Fifteen of these, including the United Kingdom,
retain a common monarch
, currently King
Charles III
.
Origins (1497-1583)
A replica of the
Matthew
,
John Cabot
's ship used for his second voyage to the
New World
in 1497
The foundations of the British Empire were laid when
England
and
Scotland
were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King
Henry VII of England
, following the successes of
Spain
and
Portugal
in overseas exploration, commissioned
John Cabot
to lead an expedition to discover a
northwest passage
to Asia via the North Atlantic.
[10]
Cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the
first voyage of Christopher Columbus
, and made landfall on the coast of
Newfoundland
. He believed he had reached Asia,
[11]
and there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but did not return; it is unknown what happened to his ships.
[12]
No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the
reign of Queen Elizabeth I
, during the last decades of the 16th century.
[13]
In the meantime,
Henry VIII
's 1533
Statute in Restraint of Appeals
had declared "that this realm of England is an Empire".
[14]
The
Protestant Reformation
turned
England
and
Catholic
Spain into implacable enemies.
[10]
In 1562, Elizabeth I encouraged the
privateers
John Hawkins
and
Francis Drake
to engage in
slave-raiding attacks
against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of
West Africa
[15]
with the aim of establishing an
Atlantic slave trade
. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the
Anglo-Spanish Wars
intensified,
Elizabeth I
gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic,
laden with treasure
from the
New World
.
[16]
At the same time, influential writers such as
Richard Hakluyt
and
John Dee
(who was the first to use the term "British Empire")
[17]
were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of
Africa
and
Brazil
to
China
, and France had begun to settle the
Saint Lawrence River
area, later to become
New France
.
[18]
Although England tended to trail behind Portugal, Spain, and France in establishing overseas colonies, it carried out its first modern colonisation, referred to as the
Munster Plantations
, in 16th century
Ireland
by settling it with English and welsh protestant settlers. England had already colonised part of the country following the
Norman invasion of Ireland
in 1169.
[19]
[20]
Several people who helped establish the Munster plantations later played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the
West Country Men
.
[21]
English overseas possessions (1583-1707)
Main article:
English overseas possessions
In 1578,
Elizabeth I
granted a patent to
Humphrey Gilbert
for discovery and overseas exploration.
[22]
[23]
That year, Gilbert sailed for the
Caribbean
with the intention of engaging in
piracy
and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic.
[24]
[25]
In 1583, he embarked on a second attempt. On this occasion, he formally claimed the harbour of the island of Newfoundland, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England and was succeeded by his half-brother,
Walter Raleigh
, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the
Roanoke Colony
on the coast of present-day
North Carolina
, but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.
[26]
In 1603,
James VI of Scotland
ascended (as James I) to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the
Treaty of London
, ending hostilities with Spain. Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies.
[27]
The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the
English settlement
of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean, and the establishment of
joint-stock companies
, most notably the
East India Company
, to administer colonies and overseas trade. This period, until the loss of the
Thirteen Colonies
after the
American War of Independence
towards the end of the 18th century, has been referred to by some historians as the "First British Empire".

Americas, Africa and the slave trade

A 1670 illustration of African slaves working in 17th-century

in
British America
England's early efforts at colonisation in the Americas met with mixed success. An attempt to establish a colony in
Guiana
in 1604 lasted only two years and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits.
[29]
Colonies on the Caribbean islands of
St Lucia
(1605) and
Grenada
(1609) rapidly folded.
[30]
The first permanent English settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in
Jamestown
by Captain
John Smith
, and managed by the
Virginia Company
; the Crown took direct control of the venture in 1624, thereby founding the
Colony of Virginia
.
[31]
Bermuda
was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck of the Virginia Company's
flagship
,
[32]
while
attempts to settle Newfoundland
were largely unsuccessful.
[33]
In 1620,
Plymouth
was founded as a haven by
Puritan
religious separatists, later known as the
Pilgrims
.
[34]
Fleeing from
religious persecution
would become the motive for many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous
trans-Atlantic voyage
:
Maryland
was established by
English Roman Catholics
(1634),
Rhode Island
(1636) as a colony
tolerant of all religions
and Connecticut (1639) for
Congregationalists
. England's North American holdings were further expanded by the annexation of the Dutch colony of
New Netherland
in 1664, following the capture of
New Amsterdam
, which was renamed
New York
.
[35]
Although less financially successful than colonies in the Caribbean, these territories had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far greater numbers of English emigrants, who preferred their temperate climates.
[36]
The
British West Indies
initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies.
[37]
Settlements were successfully established in
St. Kitts
(1624),
Barbados
(1627) and
Nevis
(1628),
[30]
but struggled until the "Sugar Revolution" transformed the Caribbean economy in the mid-17th century.
[38]
Large
sugarcane plantations
were first established in the 1640s on Barbados, with assistance from Dutch merchants and
Sephardic Jews
fleeing
Portuguese Brazil
. At first, sugar was grown primarily using white
indentured labour
, but rising costs soon led English traders to embrace the use of imported African slaves.
[39]
[40]
The enormous wealth generated by slave-produced sugar made Barbados the most successful colony in the Americas,
[41]
and one of the most densely populated places in the world.
[38]
This boom led to the spread of sugar cultivation across the Caribbean, financed the development of non-plantation colonies in North America, and accelerated the growth of the
Atlantic slave trade
, particularly the
triangular trade
of slaves, sugar and provisions between Africa, the West Indies and Europe.
[42]
To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of colonial trade remained in English hands, Parliament
decreed
in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the
United Dutch Provinces
—a series of
Anglo-Dutch Wars
—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.
[43]
In 1655, England annexed the island of
Jamaica
from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the
Bahamas
.
[44]
In 1670,
Charles II
incorporated by royal charter the
Hudson's Bay Company
(HBC), granting it a monopoly on the
fur trade
in the area known as
Rupert's Land
, which would later form a large proportion of the
Dominion of Canada
. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent
New France
.
[45]
Two years later, the
Royal African Company
was granted a monopoly on the supply of slaves to the British colonies in the Caribbean.
[46]
The company would transport more slaves across the Atlantic than any other, and significantly grew England's share of the trade, from 33 per cent in 1673 to 74 per cent in 1683.
[47]
The removal of this monopoly between 1688 and 1712 allowed independent British slave traders to thrive, leading to a rapid escalation in the number of slaves transported.
[48]
British ships carried a third of all slaves shipped across the Atlantic—approximately 3.5 million Africans
[49]
—until the abolition of the trade by Parliament in 1807 (see
§ Abolition of slavery
).
[50]
To facilitate the shipment of slaves, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as
James Island
,
Accra
and
Bunce Island
. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25 per cent in 1650 to around 80 per cent in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10 per cent to 40 per cent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies).
[51]
The transatlantic slave trade played a pervasive role in British economic life, and became a major economic mainstay for western port cities.
[52]
Ships registered in
Bristol
,
Liverpool
and
London
were responsible for the bulk of British slave trading.
[53]
For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average
mortality rate
during the
Middle Passage
was one in seven.
[54]
Rivalry with other European empires
Main article:
East India Company
Fort St. George
in
Madras
, India was founded in 1639.
At the end of the 16th century, England and the
Dutch Empire
began to challenge the
Portuguese Empire
's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the
Dutch East India Company
, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative
spice trade
, an effort focused mainly on two regions: the
East Indies archipelago
, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other.
[55]
Although England eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system
[56]
and the three
Anglo-Dutch Wars
of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the
Glorious Revolution
of 1688 when the Dutch
William of Orange
ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the
Dutch Republic
and England. A deal between the two nations left the
spice trade
of the
East Indies
archipelago to the Netherlands and the
textiles industry of India
to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability.
[56]
Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant the two countries entered the
Nine Years' War
as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their
military budget
to the costly land war in Europe.
[57]
The death of
Charles II of Spain
in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to
Philip V of Spain
, a grandson of the
King of France
, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe.
[58]
In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the
Holy Roman Empire
against Spain and France in the
War of the Spanish Succession
, which lasted for thirteen years.
[58]
Scottish attempt to expand overseas
Main article:
Scottish colonization of the Americas
In 1695, the
Parliament of Scotland
granted a charter to the
Company of Scotland
, which established a settlement in 1698 on the
Isthmus of Panama
. Besieged by neighbouring
Spanish
colonists of
New Granada
, and affected by
malaria
, the colony was abandoned two years later. The
Darien scheme
was a financial disaster for Scotland: a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise.
[59]
The episode had major political consequences, helping to persuade the government of the
Kingdom of Scotland
of the merits of turning the
personal union
with
England
into a political and economic one under the
Kingdom of Great Britain
established by the
Acts of Union 1707
.
[60]
"First" British Empire (1707-1783)
Robert Clive
's victory at the
Battle of Plassey
established the
East India Company
as both a military and commercial power.
The 18th century saw the
newly united
Great Britain rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, with France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.
[61]
Great Britain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Empire continued the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714 and was concluded by the
Treaty of Utrecht
.
Philip V of Spain
renounced his and his descendants' claim to the French throne, and Spain lost its empire in Europe.
[58]
The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained
Newfoundland
and
Acadia
, and from Spain
Gibraltar
and
Menorca
. Gibraltar became a
critical naval base
and allowed Britain to control the
Atlantic entry and exit point
to the
Mediterranean
. Spain ceded the rights to the lucrative
asiento
(permission to sell African slaves in
Spanish America
) to Britain.
[62]
With the outbreak of the Anglo-Spanish
War of Jenkins' Ear
in 1739, Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the
Triangle Trade
routes. In 1746, the Spanish and British began peace talks, with the King of Spain agreeing to stop all attacks on British shipping; however, in the
1750 Treaty of Madrid
Britain lost its slave-trading rights in
Latin America
.
[63]
In the East Indies, British and Dutch merchants continued to compete in spices and textiles. With textiles becoming the larger trade, by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.
[56]
During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were
several outbreaks of military conflict
on the
Indian subcontinent
, as the English East India Company and its
French counterpart
, struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the
Mughal Empire
. The
Battle of Plassey
in 1757, in which the British defeated the
Nawab of Bengal
and his French allies, left the British East India Company in control of
Bengal
and as the major military and political power in India.
[64]
France was left control of its
enclaves
but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British
client states
, ending French hopes of controlling India.
[65]
In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the
Presidency Armies
, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian
sepoys
, led by British officers.
[66]
The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global
Seven Years' War
(1756-1763) involving France, Britain, and the other major European powers.
[45]
The signing of the
Treaty of Paris of 1763
had important consequences for the future of the British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert's Land,
[45]
and the
ceding of New France to Britain
(leaving a sizeable
French-speaking population
under British control) and
Louisiana
to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful
maritime power
.

British colonial claims in
North America
between 1763 and 1776
During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent.
[68]
This was summarised at the time by the colonists' slogan "
No taxation without representation
", a perceived violation of the guaranteed
Rights of Englishmen
. The
American Revolution
began with a rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response, Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the
Second Continental Congress
issued the
Declaration of Independence
proclaiming the colonies' sovereignty from the British Empire as the new
United States of America
. The entry of
French
and
Spanish forces
into the war tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at
Yorktown
in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the
Peace of Paris
in 1783.
[69]
The loss of such a large portion of
British America
, at the time Britain's most populous overseas possession, is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the "first" and "second" empires,
[70]
in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa.
Adam Smith
's
Wealth of Nations
, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that
free trade
should replace the old
mercantilist
policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the
protectionism
of Spain and Portugal.
[67]
[71]
The growth of trade between the newly independent
United States
and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.
[72]
[73]
The war to the south influenced British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000
[74]
defeated
Loyalists
had migrated from the new United States following independence.
[75]
The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the
Saint John
and
Saint Croix river
valleys, then part of
Nova Scotia
, felt too far removed from the provincial government in
Halifax
, so London split off
New Brunswick
as a separate colony in 1784.
[76]
The
Constitutional Act of 1791
created the provinces of
Upper Canada
(mainly
English speaking
) and
Lower Canada
(mainly
French-speaking
) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.
[77]
Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated again during the
Napoleonic Wars
, as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to
impress
men into the
Royal Navy
. The
United States Congress
declared war, the
War of 1812
, and invaded Canadian territory. In response, Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814
Treaty of Ghent
, ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States.

Rise of the "Second" British Empire (1783-1815)
Exploration of the Pacific
Main articles:
History of Australia (1788-1850)
and
History of New Zealand
James Cook
's mission was to find the alleged southern continent
Terra Australis
.
Since 1718,
transportation
to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year.
[80]
Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to
Australia
.
[81]
The
coast of Australia
had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch
in 1606
,
[82]
but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770
James Cook
charted the eastern coast while on a scientific
voyage
, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it
New South Wales
.
[83]
In 1778,
Joseph Banks
, Cook's
botanist
on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of
Botany Bay
for the establishment of a
penal settlement
, and in 1787 the first shipment of
convicts
set sail, arriving in 1788.
[84]
Unusually, Australia was claimed through proclamation.
Indigenous Australians
were considered too uncivilised to require treaties,
[85]
[86]
and colonisation brought disease and violence that together with the deliberate dispossession of land and culture were devastating to these peoples.
[87]
[
]
[88]
Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840, to
Tasmania
until 1853 and to
Western Australia
until 1868.
[89]
The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold,
[90]
mainly because of the
Victorian gold rush
, making its capital
Melbourne
for a time the richest city in the world.
[91]
During his voyage, Cook visited
New Zealand
, known to Europeans due to the 1642 voyage of the Dutch explorer,
Abel Tasman
. Cook claimed both the
North
and the
South
islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, interaction between the indigenous
Maori
population and
European settlers
was limited to the trading of goods. European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with many trading stations being established, especially in the North. In 1839, the
New Zealand Company
announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain
William Hobson
and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the
Treaty of Waitangi
which is considered to be New Zealand's founding document, despite differing interpretations of the
Maori
and
English
versions of the text being the cause of ongoing dispute.
[92]
[93]
[94]
[95]
The British also expanded their mercantile interests in the North Pacific. Spain and Britain had become rivals in the area, culminating in the
Nootka Crisis
in 1789. Both sides mobilised for war, but when France refused to support Spain it was forced to back down, leading to the
Nootka Convention
. The outcome was a humiliation for Spain, which practically renounced all sovereignty on the North Pacific coast.
[96]
This opened the way to British expansion in the area, and a number of expeditions took place; firstly a
naval expedition
led by
George Vancouver
which explored the inlets around the Pacific North West, particularly around
Vancouver Island
.
[97]
On land, expeditions sought to discover a river route to the Pacific for the extension of the
North American fur trade
.
Alexander Mackenzie
of the
North West Company
led the first, starting out in 1792, and a year later he became the first European to reach the Pacific overland north of the
Rio Grande
, reaching the ocean near present-day
Bella Coola
. This preceded the
Lewis and Clark Expedition
by twelve years. Shortly thereafter, Mackenzie's companion,
John Finlay
, founded the first permanent European settlement in
British Columbia
,
Fort St. John
. The North West Company sought further exploration and backed expeditions by
David Thompson
, starting in 1797, and later by
Simon Fraser
. These pushed into the wilderness territories of the
Rocky Mountains
and
Interior Plateau
to the
Strait of Georgia
on the Pacific Coast, expanding
British North America
westward.
[98]
Wars with France
Main article:
French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
The
Battle of Waterloo
in 1815 ended in the defeat of
Napoleon
and marked the beginning of
Pax Britannica
.
Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations.
[99]
It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of
continental Europe
.
[100]
The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the
Royal Navy
, which won a decisive victory over a
French Imperial Navy
-
Spanish Navy
fleet at the
Battle of Trafalgar
in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815.
[101]
Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the
Ionian Islands
,
Malta
(which it had occupied in 1798),
Mauritius
,
St Lucia
, the
Seychelles
, and
Tobago
; Spain ceded
Trinidad
; the Netherlands ceded
Guyana
,
Ceylon
and the
Cape Colony
, while the Danish ceded
Heligoland
. Britain returned
Guadeloupe
,
Martinique
,
French Guiana
, and
Réunion
to France;
Menorca
to Spain;
Danish West Indies
to Denmark and
Java
and
Suriname
to the Netherlands.
[102]
Abolition of slavery
Main article:
Abolitionism in the United Kingdom
With the advent of the
Industrial Revolution
, goods produced by slavery became less important to the
British economy
.
[103]
Added to this was the cost of suppressing regular
slave rebellions
. With support from the British
abolitionist
movement,
Parliament
enacted the
Slave Trade Act
in 1807, which abolished the
slave trade
in the empire. In 1808,
Sierra Leone Colony
was designated an official British colony for freed slaves.
[104]
Parliamentary reform in 1832 saw the influence of the
West India Committee
decline. The
Slavery Abolition Act
, passed the following year, abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, finally bringing the empire into line with the law in the UK (with the exception of the territories administered by the East India Company and Ceylon, where slavery was ended in 1844). Under the Act, slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of four to six years of "apprenticeship".
[105]
Facing further opposition from abolitionists, the apprenticeship system was abolished in 1838.
[106]
The British government compensated slave-owners.

Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's "imperial century" by some historians,
[109]
[110]
around 10 million sq mi (26 million km
2
) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire.
[111]
Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than
Russia in Central Asia
.
[112]
Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the
Pax Britannica
,
[113]
[114]
[115]
and a foreign policy of "
splendid isolation
".
[116]
Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, Argentina and
Siam
, which has been described by some historians as an "
Informal Empire
".

East India Company rule and the British Raj in India
Main article:
Presidencies and provinces of British India
See also:
Company rule in India
and
British Raj
The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799),
[118]
the
capture of Java
from the Netherlands (1811), the
acquisition of Penang Island
(1786),
Singapore
(1819) and
Malacca
(1824), and the
defeat of Burma
(1826).
[112]
From its base in India, the company had been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to
Qing China
since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by China in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China.
[119]
In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at
Canton
of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the
First Opium War
, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of
Hong Kong Island
, at that time a minor settlement, and other
Treaty Ports
including
Shanghai
.
[120]
During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the
Regulating Act of 1773
,
Pitt's India Act
of 1784 and the
Charter Act of 1813
which regulated the company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired.
[121]
The company's eventual end was precipitated by the
Indian Rebellion
in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline.
[122]
The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the company and assumed direct control over India through the
Government of India Act 1858
, establishing the
British Raj
, where an appointed
governor-general
administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the
Empress of India
.
[123]
India became the empire's most valuable possession, "the Jewel in the Crown", and was the most important source of Britain's strength.
[124]
A series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century led to
widespread famines
on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.
[125]
Rivalry with Russia
Main article:
The Great Game

Balaclava
in 1854
During the 19th century, Britain and the
Russian Empire
vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining
Ottoman Empire
,
Qajar dynasty
and
Qing dynasty
. This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the "Great Game".
[126]
As far as Britain was concerned, defeats inflicted by Russia on
Persia
and
Turkey
demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India.
[127]
In 1839, Britain moved to pre-empt this by invading
Afghanistan
, but the
First Anglo-Afghan War
was a disaster for Britain.
[128]
When Russia invaded the
Ottoman Balkans
in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and the Middle East led Britain and France to enter the war in support of the
Ottoman Empire
and invade the
Crimean Peninsula
to destroy Russian naval capabilities.
[128]
The ensuing
Crimean War
(1854-1856), which involved new techniques of
modern warfare
,
[129]
was the only
global war
fought between Britain and another
imperial power
during the
Pax Britannica
and was a resounding defeat for Russia.
[128]
The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing
Baluchistan
in 1876 and Russia annexing
Kirghizia
,
Kazakhstan
, and
Turkmenistan
. For a while, it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective
spheres of influence
in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the
Anglo-Russian Entente
.
[130]
The destruction of the
Imperial Russian Navy
by the
Imperial Japanese Navy
at the
Battle of Tsushima
during the
Russo-Japanese War
of 1904-1905 limited its threat to the British.

spanning "Cape to Cairo"
The Dutch East India Company had founded the
Dutch Cape Colony
on the
southern tip of Africa
in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the
East Indies
. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large
Afrikaner
(or
Boer
) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the
Flanders Campaign
.
[132]
British immigration to the
Cape Colony
began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of
Boers
, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—
independent republics
, during the
Great Trek
of the late 1830s and early 1840s.
[133]
In the process the
Voortrekkers
clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the
Sotho people
and the
Zulu Kingdom
. Eventually, the Boers established two republics that had a longer lifespan: the
South African Republic
or Transvaal Republic (1852-1877; 1881-1902) and the
Orange Free State
(1854-1902).
[134]
In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two
Boer Republics
following the
Second Boer War
(1899-1902).
[135]
In 1869 the
Suez Canal
opened under
Napoleon III
, linking the
Mediterranean Sea
with the
Indian Ocean
. Initially the Canal was opposed by the British;
[136]
but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the "jugular vein of the Empire".
[137]
In 1875, the
Conservative
government of
Benjamin Disraeli
bought the indebted Egyptian ruler
Isma'il Pasha
's 44 per cent shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (equivalent to £400 million in 2021). Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.
[138]
Although Britain controlled the
Khedivate of Egypt
into the 20th century, it was officially a
vassal state of the Ottoman Empire
and not part of the British Empire. The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position,
[139]
but a compromise was reached with the 1888
Convention of Constantinople
, which made the Canal officially neutral territory.
[140]
With competitive French,
Belgian
and Portuguese activity in the lower
Congo River
region undermining orderly colonisation of tropical Africa, the
Berlin Conference
of 1884-85 was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the "
Scramble for Africa
" by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.
[141]
The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from
Sudan
. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the
Mahdist Army
in 1896 and rebuffed an attempted French invasion
at Fashoda
in 1898. Sudan was nominally made an
Anglo-Egyptian condominium
, but a British colony in reality.
[142]
British gains in Southern and East Africa prompted
Cecil Rhodes
, pioneer of British expansion in
Southern Africa
, to urge a "
Cape to Cairo
" railway linking the strategically important Suez Canal to the mineral-rich south of the continent.
[143]
During the 1880s and 1890s, Rhodes, with his privately owned
British South Africa Company
,
occupied and annexed
territories named after him,
Rhodesia
.

Changing status of the white colonies
Main articles:
Dominions
,

, and
Independence of New Zealand
The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839
Durham Report
, which proposed unification and self-government for Upper and Lower Canada, as a solution to political unrest which had erupted in
armed rebellions
in 1837.
[145]
This began with the passing of the
Act of Union
in 1840, which created the
Province of Canada
.
Responsible government
was first granted to Nova Scotia in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the
British North America Act, 1867
by the
British Parliament
, the Province of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of
international relations
.
[146]
Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies
federating in 1901
.
[147]
The term "dominion status" was officially introduced at the
1907 Imperial Conference
.
[148]
The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted
political campaigns
for Irish
home rule
. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the
Act of Union 1800
after the
Irish Rebellion of 1798
, and had suffered a severe
famine
between 1845 and 1852. Home rule was supported by the British
Prime minister
,
William Gladstone
, who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886
Home Rule bill
was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation,
[149]
many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire.
[150]
A
second Home Rule bill
was defeated for similar reasons.
[150]
A
third bill
was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the
First World War
leading to the 1916
Easter Rising
.
[151]
World wars (1914-1945)
A poster urging men from countries of the British Empire to enlist
By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the
metropole
and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of "splendid isolation".
[152]
Germany
was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war. Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific
[153]
and threatened at home by the
Imperial German Navy
, Britain
formed an alliance with Japan
in 1902 and with its old enemies
France
and Russia in 1904 and 1907, respectively.
[154]
First World War
Main article:
History of the United Kingdom during the First World War
Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied
German New Guinea
and
German Samoa
respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916
Sykes-Picot Agreement
. This agreement was not divulged to the
Sharif of Mecca
, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.
[155]
The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies committed the colonies and Dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. Over 2.5 million men served in the armies of the
Dominions
, as well as many thousands of volunteers from the Crown colonies.
[156]
The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915
Gallipoli Campaign
against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right. The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on
Anzac Day
. Canadians viewed the
Battle of Vimy Ridge
in a similar light.
[157]
The important contribution of the Dominions to the
war effort
was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister
David Lloyd George
when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an
Imperial War Cabinet
to co-ordinate imperial policy.
[158]
Under the terms of the concluding
Treaty of Versailles
signed in 1919, the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of 1.8 million sq mi (4.7 million km
2
) and 13 million new subjects.
[159]
The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as
League of Nations mandates
. Britain gained control of
Palestine
,
Transjordan
,
Iraq
, parts of
Cameroon
and
Togoland
, and
Tanganyika
. The Dominions themselves acquired mandates of their own: the
Union of South Africa
gained South West Africa (modern-day
Namibia
), Australia gained
New Guinea
, and New Zealand
Western Samoa
.
Nauru
was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.

The British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921
The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy.
[161]
Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its
Anglo-Japanese Alliance
and instead signed the 1922
Washington Naval Treaty
, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States.
[162]
This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s
[163]
as militaristic governments took hold in Germany and Japan helped in part by the
Great Depression
, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations.
[164]
The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the
British economy
.
[165]
In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to
Irish home rule
led the MPs of
Sinn Féin
, a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats in the
1918 British general election
, to establish an
independent parliament
in
Dublin
, at which
Irish independence was declared
. The
Irish Republican Army
simultaneously began a
guerrilla war
against the British administration.
[166]
The
Irish War of Independence
ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the
Anglo-Irish Treaty
, creating the
Irish Free State
, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown.
[167]
Northern Ireland
, consisting of six of the 32
Irish counties
which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920
Government of Ireland Act
, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.
[168]
George V

1926 Imperial Conference
A similar struggle began in India when the
Government of India Act 1919
failed to satisfy the demand for independence.
[169]
Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the
Ghadar conspiracy
ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the
Rowlatt Acts
. This led to tension,
[170]
particularly in the
Punjab region
, where repressive measures culminated in the
Amritsar Massacre
. In Britain, public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.
[170]
The
non-cooperation movement
was called off in March 1922 following the
Chauri Chaura incident
, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.
[171]
In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British
protectorate
at the outbreak of the First World War, was
granted formal independence
, though it continued to be a British client state until 1954.
British troops
remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the
Anglo-Egyptian Treaty
in 1936,
[172]
under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the
League of Nations
.
[173]
Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.
[174]
In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The
Balfour Declaration
, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power.
[175]
This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly
revolted in 1936
. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a
Jewish insurgency
.
[155]
The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the
1923 Imperial Conference
.
[176]
Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the
Chanak Crisis
the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the
1923 Treaty of Lausanne
.
[177]
[178]
After pressure from the Irish Free State and South Africa, the
1926 Imperial Conference
issued the
Balfour Declaration of 1926
, declaring the Dominions to be "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another" within a "British Commonwealth of Nations".
[179]
This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931
Statute of Westminster
.
[148]
The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and
Newfoundland
were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify
British laws
and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.
[180]
Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression.
[181]
In 1937 the Irish Free State introduced a
republican constitution
renaming itself
Ireland
.
[182]
Second World War
Main article:
British Empire in World War II
During the
Second World War
, the
Eighth Army
was made up of units from many different countries in the British Empire and Commonwealth; it fought in the
North African
and
Italian
campaigns.
Britain's declaration of war against
Nazi Germany
in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany. While Britain continued to regard Ireland as still within the British Commonwealth, Ireland chose to remain
legally neutral
throughout
the war
.
[183]
After the
Fall of France
in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the
German invasion of Greece
on 7 April 1941. British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
successfully lobbied President
Franklin D. Roosevelt
for
military aid
from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask
Congress
to commit the country to war.
[184]
In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the
Atlantic Charter
, which included the statement that "the rights of all peoples to choose the
form of government
under which they live" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.
[185]
[186]
For Churchill, the entry of the United States into the war was the "greatest joy".
[187]
He felt that Britain was now assured of victory,
[188]
but failed to recognise that the "many disasters, immeasurable costs and tribulations [which he knew] lay ahead"
[189]
in December 1941 would have permanent consequences for the future of the empire. The manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power,
[190]
[191]
including, particularly, the
Fall of Singapore
, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar.
[192]
The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States and, ultimately, the 1951
ANZUS Pact
.
[185]
The war weakened the empire in other ways: undermining Britain's control of politics in India, inflicting long-term economic damage, and irrevocably changing geopolitics by pushing the Soviet Union and the United States to the centre of the global stage.
[193]
Decolonisation and decline (1945-1997)
Further information:
Decolonization
Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power.
[194]
Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of
a US$4.33 billion loan
from the United States,
[195]
the last installment of which was repaid in 2006.
[196]
At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing
Cold War
rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, American
anti-communism
prevailed over
anti-imperialism
, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check.
[197]
At first, British politicians believed it would be possible to maintain Britain's role as a world power at the head of a re-imagined Commonwealth,
[198]
but by 1960 they were forced to recognise that there was an irresistible "
wind of change
" blowing. Their priorities changed to maintaining an extensive zone of British influence
[199]
and ensuring that stable, non-Communist governments were established in former colonies.
[200]
In this context, while other European powers such as France and Portugal waged costly and unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact, Britain generally adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies, although violence occurred in Malaya, Kenya and Palestine.
[201]
Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to 5 million, 3 million of whom were in Hong Kong.
[202]
Initial disengagement
Main articles:
Partition of India
,
1947-1949 Palestine war
, and
Malayan Emergency
About 14.5 million people lost their homes as a result of the
partition of India
in 1947.
The pro-decolonisation
Labour
government, elected at the
1945 general election
and led by
Clement Attlee
, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire:
Indian independence
.
[203]
India's two major political parties—the
Indian National Congress
(led by
Mahatma Gandhi
) and the
Muslim League
(led by
Muhammad Ali Jinnah
)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate
Islamic state
for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing
civil unrest
and the
mutiny
of the
Royal Indian Navy
during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 30 June 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy,
Lord Mountbatten
, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947.
[204]
The borders drawn by the British to broadly
partition India
into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and
Pakistan
.
[205]
Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of
British India
until 1937, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.
[206]
The British Mandate in Palestine, where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India.
[207]
The matter was complicated by large numbers of
Jewish refugees
seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the
Holocaust
, while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve.
[208]
The
UN General Assembly
subsequently voted for a
plan to partition Palestine
into a Jewish and an Arab state. It was immediately followed by the outbreak of a
civil war
between the Arabs and Jews of Palestine, and British forces withdrew amid the fighting. The British Mandate for Palestine officially terminated at midnight on 15 May 1948 as the State of
Israel
declared independence and the
1948 Arab-Israeli War
broke out, during which the territory of the former Mandate was partitioned between Israel and the surrounding Arab states. Amid the fighting, British forces continued to withdraw from Israel, with the last British troops departing from
Haifa
on 30 June 1948.
[209]
Following the
surrender of Japan
in the Second World War, anti-Japanese
resistance movements
in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it as a source of rubber and tin.
[210]
The fact that the guerrillas were primarily
Malaysian Chinese
Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the
Muslim Malay
majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted.
[210]
The
Malayan Emergency
, as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the
Federation of Malaya
within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and
North Borneo
joined to form
Malaysia
, but in 1965 Chinese-majority
Singapore
was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations and became an independent city-state.
[211]
Brunei
, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union.
[212]
Suez and its aftermath
Main article:
Suez Crisis
Eden
's decision to invade
Egypt
in 1956 revealed Britain's post-war weaknesses.
In the
1951 general election
, the
Conservative Party
returned to power in Britain under the leadership of Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. Churchill could not ignore
Gamal Abdul Nasser
's new revolutionary
government of Egypt
that had
taken power in 1952
, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.
[213]
Sudan was
granted independence
on 1 January 1956.
[214]
In July 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of
Anthony Eden
, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on
Egypt
that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal.
[215]
Eden infuriated US President
Dwight D. Eisenhower
by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion.
[216]
Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the
Soviet Union
after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied
financial leverage
by threatening to sell US reserves of the
British pound
and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency.
[217]
Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives,
[218]
UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.
[219]
[220]
The
Suez Crisis
very publicly exposed Britain's limitations to the world and confirmed Britain's decline on the world stage and its end as a first-rate power,
[221]
[222]
demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States.
[223]
[224]
[225]
The events at Suez wounded British
national pride
, leading one
Member of Parliament
(MP) to describe it as "Britain's
Waterloo
"
[226]
and another to suggest that the country had become an "American
satellite
".
[227]
Margaret Thatcher
later described the mindset she believed had befallen Britain's political leaders after Suez where they "went from believing that Britain could do anything to an almost neurotic belief that Britain could do nothing", from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the
Falkland Islands
from Argentina in 1982.
[228]
While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse.
[229]
Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in
Oman
(
1957
),
Jordan
(
1958
) and
Kuwait
(
1961
), though on these occasions with American approval,
[230]
as the new Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan
's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States.
[226]
Although Britain granted Kuwait independence in 1961, it continued to maintain a military presence in the Middle East for another decade. On 16 January 1968, a few weeks after the
devaluation of the pound
, Prime Minister
Harold Wilson
and his Defence Secretary
Denis Healey
announced that
British Armed Forces
troops would be withdrawn from major military bases
East of Suez
, which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore by the end of 1971, instead of 1975 as earlier planned.
[231]
By that time over 50,000 British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East, including 30,000 in Singapore.
[232]
The British granted independence to the
Maldives
in 1965 but continued to station a garrison there until 1976, withdrew from
Aden
in 1967, and granted independence to
Bahrain
,
Qatar
, and the
United Arab Emirates
in 1971.
[233]
Wind of change
Main articles:
Decolonisation of Africa
and
Decolonization of Asia
Further information:
Wind of Change (speech)
British decolonisation in Africa. By the end of the 1960s, all but
Rhodesia
(the future Zimbabwe) and the South African mandate of South West Africa (Namibia) had achieved recognised independence.
Macmillan gave a speech in
Cape Town
, South Africa in February 1960 where he spoke of "the wind of change blowing through this continent".
[234]
Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of
colonial war
that France was fighting in
Algeria
, and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly.
[235]
To the three colonies that had been granted independence in the 1950s—Sudan, the
Gold Coast
and Malaya—were added nearly ten times that number during the 1960s.
[236]
Owing to the rapid pace of decolonisation during this period, the cabinet post of
Secretary of State for the Colonies
was abolished in 1966, along with the
Colonial Office
, which merged with the Commonwealth Relations Office to form the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (now the
Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office
) in October 1968.
[237]
Britain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for self-governing
Southern Rhodesia
, were all granted independence by 1968. British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year
Mau Mau uprising
, in which tens of thousands of suspected rebels were interned by the colonial government in detention camps.
[238]
Throughout the 1960s, the British government took a "
No independence until majority rule
" policy towards decolonising the empire, leading the white minority government of Southern Rhodesia to enact the 1965
Unilateral Declaration of Independence
from Britain, resulting in a
civil war
that lasted until the British-mediated
Lancaster House Agreement
of 1979.
[239]
The agreement saw the British Empire temporarily re-establish the Colony of Southern Rhodesia from 1979 to 1980 as a transitionary government to a majority-rule
Republic of Zimbabwe
. This was the last British possession in Africa.
In
Cyprus
, a guerrilla war waged by the
Greek Cypriot
organisation
EOKA
against British rule, was ended in 1959 by the
London and Zürich Agreements
, which resulted in Cyprus being granted independence in 1960. The UK retained the military bases of
Akrotiri and Dhekelia
as sovereign base areas. The
Mediterranean
colony of
Malta
was amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of
Malta
, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of
integration with Britain
.
[240]
Most of the UK's Caribbean territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of Jamaica and Trinidad from the
West Indies Federation
, established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members.
[241]
Jamaica attained independence in 1962, as did
Trinidad and Tobago
. Barbados achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands, including the
Bahamas
, in the 1970s and 1980s,
[241]
but
Anguilla
and the
Turks and Caicos Islands
opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence.
[242]
The
British Virgin Islands
,
[243]
The
Cayman Islands
and
Montserrat
opted to retain ties with Britain,
[244]
while Guyana achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland,
British Honduras
, became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed
Belize
in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A
dispute with Guatemala
over claims to Belize was left unresolved.
[245]
British Overseas Territories
in the Pacific acquired independence in the 1970s beginning with
Fiji
in 1970 and ending with
Vanuatu
in 1980. Vanuatu's independence was delayed because of political conflict between English and French-speaking communities, as the islands had been jointly administered as a
condominium
with France.
[246]
Fiji,
Papua New Guinea
,
Solomon Islands
and
Tuvalu
became
Commonwealth realms
.
[247]
End of empire
See also:
Falklands War
,
Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong
, and
Patriation
By 1981, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts, the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when
Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands
, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the
Spanish Empire
.
[248]
Britain's successful military response to retake the
Falkland Islands
during the ensuing
Falklands War
contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power.
[249]
The 1980s saw Canada, Australia, and New Zealand sever their final constitutional links with Britain. Although granted legislative independence by the Statute of Westminster 1931, vestigial constitutional links had remained in place. The British Parliament retained the power to amend key Canadian constitutional statutes, meaning that effectively an act of the British Parliament was required to make certain changes to the
Canadian Constitution
.
[250]
The British Parliament had the power to pass laws extending to Canada at Canadian request. Although no longer able to pass any laws that would apply as Australian Commonwealth law, the British Parliament retained the power to legislate for the individual
Australian states
. With regard to New Zealand, the British Parliament retained the power to pass legislation applying to New Zealand with the
New Zealand Parliament
's consent. In 1982, the last legal link between Canada and Britain was severed by the
Canada Act 1982
, which was passed by the British parliament, formally
patriating
the Canadian Constitution. The act ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution.
[9]
Similarly, the
Australia Act 1986
(effective 3 March 1986) severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states, while New Zealand's
Constitution Act 1986
(effective 1 January 1987) reformed the constitution of New Zealand to sever its constitutional link with Britain.
[251]
On 1 January 1984, Brunei, Britain's last remaining Asian protectorate, was granted independence.
[252]
Independence had been delayed due to the opposition of the
Sultan
, who had preferred British protection.
[253]
In September 1982 the Prime Minister,
Margaret Thatcher
, travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese Communist government, on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong.
[254]
Under the terms of the 1842
Treaty of Nanking
and 1860
Convention of Peking
,
Hong Kong Island
and
Kowloon Peninsula
had been respectively ceded to Britain
in perpetuity
, but the majority of the colony consisted of the
New Territories
, which had been acquired under a
99-year lease in 1898
, due to expire in 1997.
[255]
[256]
Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China.
[257]
A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration
, Hong Kong would become a
special administrative region of the People's Republic of China
.
[258]
The
handover ceremony
in 1997 marked for many,
[8]
including King Charles III, then Prince of Wales, who was in attendance, "the end of Empire", though many British territories that are remnants of the empire still remain.
[9]
Legacy
Main articles:
British Overseas Territories
,

,

, and
Common law
The fourteen
British Overseas Territories
Britain retains sovereignty over 14 territories outside the British Isles. In 1983, the
British Nationality Act 1981
renamed the existing
Crown Colonies
as "British Dependent Territories",
[note 1]
and in 2002 they were renamed the
British Overseas Territories
.
[261]
Most former British colonies and protectorates are members of the
Commonwealth of Nations
, a
voluntary association
of equal members, comprising a population of around 2.2 billion people.
[262]
The United Kingdom and 14 other countries, all collectively known as the
Commonwealth realms
, voluntarily continue to share the same person—King
Charles III
—as their respective head of state. These 15 nations are distinct and equal legal entities: the
United Kingdom
,
Australia
,
Canada
,
New Zealand
,
Antigua and Barbuda
,
The Bahamas
,
Belize
,
Grenada
,
Jamaica
,
Papua New Guinea
,
Saint Kitts and Nevis
,
Saint Lucia
,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
,
Solomon Islands
and
Tuvalu
.
[263]
Decades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that rose from the British Empire. The empire established the use of the
English language
in regions around the world. Today it is the primary language of up to 460 million people and is spoken by about 1.5 billion as a first, second or foreign language.
[264]
Individual and team sports developed in Britain, particularly
football
,
cricket
,
lawn tennis
, and
golf
were exported.
[265]
British
missionaries
who travelled around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread
Protestantism
(including
Anglicanism
) to all continents. The British Empire provided refuge for religiously persecuted continental Europeans for hundreds of years.
[266]
Cricket
being played in
India
. Sports developed in Britain or the former empire continue to be viewed and played.
Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the
British Isles
, with the founding
settler colonist
populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in
Ireland
from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided
nationalist
and
unionist
communities in Northern Ireland. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of
Overseas Indian
people emigrating to other parts of the empire, such as Malaysia and Fiji, and
Overseas Chinese
people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean.
[267]
The
demographics of the United Kingdom
itself were changed after the Second World War owing to
immigration to Britain
from its former colonies.
[268]
In the 19th century,
innovation in Britain
led to revolutionary changes in manufacturing, the development of
factory systems
, and the growth of transportation by railway and steamship.
[269]
British colonial architecture, such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, can be seen in many cities that were once part of the British Empire.
[270]
The British choice of system of measurement, the
imperial system
, continues to be used in some countries in various ways. The convention of
driving on the left-hand side of the road
has been retained in much of the former empire.
[271]
The
Westminster system
of
parliamentary democracy
has served as the template for the governments for many former colonies,
[272]
[273]
and
English common law
for legal systems.
[274]
International commercial contracts are often based on English common law.
[275]
The British
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
still serves as the highest court of appeal for twelve former colonies.
[276]
Historians'
approaches to understanding the British Empire
are diverse and evolving.
[277]
Two key sites of debate over recent decades have been the impact of
post-colonial studies
, which seek to
critically
re-evaluate the history of imperialism, and the continued relevance of historians
Ronald Robinson
and
John Gallagher
, whose work greatly influenced imperial historiography during the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, differing assessments of the empire's legacy remain relevant to debates over recent history and politics, such as the Anglo-American
invasions of Iraq
and
Afghanistan
, as well as Britain's role and identity in the contemporary world.
[278]
[279]
Historians such as
Caroline Elkins
have argued against perceptions of the British Empire as a primarily liberalising and modernising enterprise, criticising its widespread use of violence and
emergency laws
to maintain power.
[279]
[280]
Common criticisms of the empire include the use of detention camps in its colonies, massacres of
indigenous peoples
,
[281]
and famine-response policies.
[282]
[283]
Some scholars, including
Amartya Sen
, assert that British policies worsened the
famines in India
that killed millions during British rule.
[284]
Conversely, historians such as
Niall Ferguson
say that the economic and institutional development the British Empire brought resulted in a net benefit to its colonies.
[285]
Other historians treat its legacy as varied and ambiguous.
[279]
Public attitudes towards the empire within Britain remain somewhat positive.

Said bin Taimur
(
Arabic
:
سعيد بن تيمور
; 13 August 1910 - 19 October 1972) was the 13th Sultan of
Muscat and Oman
from 10 February 1932 until he was
deposed on 23 July 1970
by his son
Qaboos bin Said
.
He was a member of the
House of Al Said
who in 1932 became the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, succeeding his father
Taimur bin Feisal
who had abdicated for financial reasons. The 21-year-old Said inherited an administration that was in debt. He consolidated power, with the help of the
British SAS
, and regained control of the tribal interior, bringing together Muscat and Oman. Once the country was united, Said left the capital of
Muscat
and resided in a coastal town in
Dhofar
. Muscat and Oman became fully sovereign and independent states in 1951 with him as ruler.
Early life and education
[
edit
]
Said was born in 1910.
[1]
He attended
Mayo College
at
Ajmer
in
Rajputana
, India, from 1922-1927 where he mastered
English
and
Urdu
. Upon his return to Muscat in May 1927, it was suggested he attend
Beirut
to further his education. His father, Sultan Taimur bin Feisal, feared that by sending him to Beirut, he would be influenced by Christianity.
[2]
Said’s father was strongly against him learning the ways of the Western world and speaking English. When Said was younger, his father found Sa’id and his brother Nadir possessing an English primer, and he ordered all their books be burned. Instead of sending Said to Beirut, his father sent him to
Baghdad
to study

Early political career
[
edit
]
After completing his year-long study in
Baghdad
, Said participated in the Omani government upon his return home. He became the president of the
Council of Ministers
in August 1929. Sultan Taimur’s inability to govern the state affairs of
Oman
created an opportunity for a new leader. The British were very fond of Said and during February 1932, at the age of 21, Said became the new crowned Sultan.
[3]
Sultan Said inherited a country that was heavily in debt to Britain and
British India
. In order to break away from Britain and maintain autonomy, his country needed to regain economic independence. Therefore, beginning in 1933, he controlled the budget of the state until being overthrown in 1970.
[3]
Family affairs
[
edit
]
In 1936, Said married his second wife,
Mezoon al-Mashani
(cousin of his first wife, Fatima)
[

who in 1940 gave birth to Said's only son and heir Qaboos.
Said had three children

Reign
[
edit

Accession
[
edit
]
On his accession, he inherited the remains of the
Omani Empire
, which included the neighbouring provinces of Oman and
Dhofar
, as well as the last remnants of an overseas empire, including
Gwadar
in the
Arabian Sea
. Nevertheless, his
petroleum
-rich country also had long established ties with the
United Kingdom
, based on a 1798 Treaty of Friendship, and had been a British protectorate since 1891. He also inherited an administration that was in debt.

Foreign affairs
[
edit
]
Once he became Sultan, Said maintained a friendly relationship with the
United States
. In 1938, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
invited Said and his father to visit the United States. Said landed in
San Francisco
and began a tour from
California
to
Washington, D.C.
During his visit to the
White House
, Roosevelt presented him with two books he had written. Said toured the
FBI Headquarters
, and laid a wreath upon
George Washington
’s tomb, at
Mount Vernon
.
[2]
During
World War II
, the Sultan cooperated readily with the British; several Royal Air Force landing fields were constructed between
Salalah
in
Dhofar
and
Mascat
. This allowed the channels of supply to remain open between Britain and the Allies.
[2]
Leadership
[
edit
]
Oil wealth would have allowed Said to modernize his country. He secured British recognition of its independence in 1951. Nevertheless, he also faced serious internal opposition, from Imam
Ghalib bin Ali
, a religious leader of Oman, who claimed power in the sultanate for himself. The Imam's
revolt in Jebel Akhdar
was suppressed in 1955, with British help, but this in turn earned Said the animosity of
Saudi Arabia
, which supported the Imam, and of
Egypt
, which regarded British involvement in suppressing the revolt as not conducive to the cause of
Arab nationalism
. In 1957, these two countries supported a renewed revolt by the Imam, which was similarly suppressed by 1959.
In 1958 Said
sold Gwadar to Pakistan
for $1 million, while in 1967 Britain returned the
Khuriya Muriya Islands
.
Said became more reclusive from his people and country. In 1965, after making concessions to export oil with Iraq, Iran and Britain, he did little to improve the life of his people. The benefits of this deal would not come to fruition until his was deposed in 1970 in a palace coup.
In 1965, the province of
Dhofar
revolted
, this time with the support of the
People's Republic of China
and some of the nationalist
Arab
states, followed by an assassination attempt in 1966. It had a marked effect on Said, causing him to become even more erratic in governing the country. It was forbidden to smoke in public, to play football, to wear sunglasses or to speak to anyone for more than 15 minutes.
[4]
No one was safe from the sultan's paranoia, not even his own son,
Qaboos
, who was kept under virtual
house arrest
at the Sultan's palace in
Salalah
.
Before he was overthrown in 1970, because of his backwards policies, Oman had an under 5 mortality rate of around 25%.
[5]
Trachoma
,
venereal disease
and
malnutrition
were widespread. There were only three schools, the literacy rate was 5%, and there were only 10 kilometres (6 mi) of paved roads.
[6]
Deposition
[
edit
]
Qaboos returned from his educational studies in the  United Kingdom at the
Royal Military Academy
, and a year of service in the
British Army infantry
in 1964, and was placed under house arrest.
[7]
Said did not speak to his son during the last 14 months before the coup, even though they lived in the same palace.
[

]
On 23 July 1970 at the Sultan’s palace in
Salalah
, Qaboos executed a
successful coup
against his father with the help of the British and his uncle, and exiled his father to the
United Kingdom
. Said lived his last two years at the
Dorchester Hotel
in
London
.
[8]
He was originally buried in
Brookwood Cemetery
,
Woking
,
Surrey
,
England
. His remains were then disinterred and transported back to Oman, and he was buried in the royal cemetery in
Muscat
.

Overview
[
edit
]
Purchase of Manhattan Island. Alfred Frederickson (1909)
Indian commercial development is defined by as the economic evolution of Native American tribes from
hunter-gatherer
based societies into fur-trade-based industries. From the early 1500s to the 1800s, intertribal and European relationships evolved in response to the growth of
English settlements
into the United States.
The commercial relationship of each tribe was dependent upon its geographic resources and the cultural region it was a part in. Native American trade
previous to European contact
was limited to neighboring tribes as a method to define tribal and social boundaries.
[1]
The goods traded depended upon each tribes specialization, but each tribe was non dependent upon external trade for survival.
[2]
The development of trade between European traders and native tribes led to native tribes to specialize in
fur trade
in exchange for European goods.
Economic contact between Native Americans and English settlers began in the 16th century and lasted until the 19th century. Early relationship between the English and local tribes were dependent upon the
animal furs and pelts
. Initial English settlement such as
Jamestown
and
Plymouth
depended on local tribes for a large portion of their livelihood.
[3]
As settlements became colonies,
conflict
steadily rose between both parties as English colonists occupied more lands and territories.
With the notable population growth of English colonies, dependence upon tribal goods dissipated. Indian tribes of the
North Eastern woodlands
became increasingly dependent upon colonial goods. By the time of the foundation of the United States, the importance of tribal commerce was in decline.
The steady expansion of the United States led to the disenfranchisement of Native Americans. Commercially, goods provided by Native Americans such as furs, had lost significance in the American economy.
Political agendas
were created that led to the steady expulsion of Native American tribes which confined them to
reservations
in the West.
By the 1800s, Native American commercial power had all but diminished due to the subjugation of the United States government. Today, Native Americans satisfy commercial demand concerning gaming casinos and provided cultural goods.
Pre-English settlement
[
edit
]
From the outset of the sixteenth century, Native American societies are characterized as
hunter-gatherer societies
and horticulturalist societies. This era is classified as the
Pre-Columbian Era.
The specialization of each tribe was dependent upon the geographic factors of their territory. (E.g. North eastern tribes such as the
Iroquois
engaged in seasonal migration to hunt for moose and shellfish,)  Previous to any European contact, many tribes focused their economies on the exploitation of furs. The first trade between finished European goods for Indian furs began in 1641 with French Jesuit priests in Great Lake region. This initial contact lead to the development of the fur trade, specifically beaver pelts, which paved the way for French and later English colonization.
Although European migration had a significant impact upon the economic development, it also impacted the social structure of tribes. The incoming migration led to the formation of federations and new tribes.
Native American pre-colonization commerce
[
edit
]
Native American commerce was largely dependent upon the geography surrounding each of the tribes. These geographic areas came to find loose
cultural boundaries
which defined the economic structure of many tribes. General information for each region can be found here:
North Eastern Woodlands
Southeastern Woodlands
Great Plains
Great Basin
Northwest Plateau
Northwest Coast
California
Southwest
The exact nature of the trade
pre-European contact
is not known, but general inferences may be drawn. Trade was extensive between tribal communities since luxury goods such as copper, shells, and stone moved great distances.
[4]
Trade of useful commodities such as perishable goods was limited to local neighboring tribes.
Trade between Native Americans was not directed towards profits. Trade had the function of providing communities with useful goods that they lacked, and served to reinforce social and territorial boundaries. Thus, goods processed as surplus in one community to another. An example of this is when the
Huron's
would trade surplus farm produce to the neighboring Algonkians.
[4]
The earliest trade relations with incoming European trades consisted of the trade of furs and agricultural goods in return for metals and cloth goods focused in the North Eastern Woodlands and Great Lakes area.
[5]
The development led to the increased specialization of each tribe as the trade in furs for goods became increasingly beneficial for tribes. Consequences of the fur trade led to the depletion of beavers and exploitation of resources in the area. The exploration of Native American fur and labor from European trading companies began extensively in the time period between 1600s-1700s.
[6]
(pg 25)
The development of the fur trade led to the establishment of firm social and political boundaries between tribes as well as the establishment of coalitions and confederacies between tribes. Popular confederations that came into existence in the 1630s are the
Iroquois
nation, the
Pontiacs of 1760
, and the coalition of
Algonqian
tribes which traded with the French in the great lakes region. These organizations developed purely as the product of the fur trade.
[7]
Trade with English settlers
[
edit
]
The Landing of the Pilgrims
As English settlers came to the
New World
trade took upon the role of peacekeeping and necessity for the English settlers. In order to have a functional and healthy relationship with the
Native Americans in the United States
at that time, the English would trade certain goods; such as food, spices, weapons, tools, etc. to the Indians in return to access to fertile lands, use of waterways, and even rough maps depicting the layout of the land.
[8]
When trade was happening with the early settlers the overall relationship between the English Colonists and
Native Americans
was very healthy. The Indians could have been savage and harmful to the English, but they understood the trade relationship as a way to better both parties and
British colonization of the Americas
was more successful because of this.
[9]
Major challenges occurred due to occasional exploitation of Native American goods by settlers. This led to a steady deterioration of commercial trust between Native tribes and settlers.
[10]
Plymouth and Northern Settlers
[
edit
]
Plymouth
/ˈplɪməθ/ (historically known as Plimouth and Plimoth) is a town in Plymouth County,
Massachusetts
, United States. Plymouth holds a place of great prominence in American history and is typically the most well known of the Northern Settlements. Plymouth was the site of the colony founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims, passengers of the famous ship the
Mayflower
. Before the arrival of the
Mayflower
earlier explorations killed between 90 and 95% of the local native inhabitants due to disease. The near disappearance of the tribe from the site not only left their cornfields and other cleared areas for the
Pilgrims
to take over, but also meant that the Indians were in no condition to disrupt the arrival of the colonists. With the dwindling numbers of Native Indians in the area they relied heavily on trade for subsistence and survival.
[11]
They traded livestock for farming land and farming techniques. The overall relationship was good until the formation of
Dominion of New England
.

Second Charter
). Made by
Willem Blaeu
between 1609 and 1638.
Jamestown and Southern settlers
[
edit
]
Jamestown
and Southern settlers relied very much on the Indians for almost all their food which the Indians gave gladly for the exchange of precious metal. The area where Jamestown was settled, was that it was not inhabited by nearby Virginian Indian tribes, who regarded the site as too poor and remote for agriculture. The island was swampy, isolated, offered limited space and was plagued by mosquitoes and polluted tidal river water unsuitable for drinking. Due to this agricultural products, building materials, and minimal livestock was traded from Indians to Jamestown
[12]
and other southern settlements in close proximity for precious metals, glassware, tools, and other instruments the Indians were unfamiliar with. As other southern settlers left Jamestown and furthered the exploration in the area they were often welcomed by the Indians with dancing, feasting and tobacco ceremonies. As relationships developed in the southern areas so did the need for healthy trade. The Indians realized that these explorers were not just passing through but looking to colonize and further expand their living areas. After several years of strained coexistence, Chief
Opchanacanough
and his
Powhatan Confederacy
attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all. On the morning of March 22, 1622, they attacked outlying plantations and communities up and down the James River in what became known as the
Indian Massacre of 1622
. The attack killed over 300 settlers, about a third of the English-speaking population.
Trade with English Colonies
[
edit
]
English colonies became permanent fixtures in the New America, trade became all the more important to keeping civility with the Indians.
[13]
For most of the Colonies established in the Eastern States as Indians realized their colonies were here to stay, the Englishman were often met with much resistance and even war.
[13]
Large colonies that were growing quicker everyday were threatening to destroy much of precious land held by the Indians.
[14]
Also with the increased population came foreign disease which spread quickly among Indian colonies. Trade became tense and limited during these times of sickness and disease. In some Indian history the white man became a hated person. The more successful trade routes between
English colonists
and
Native Americans in the United States
were from explorers and mappers,
[15]
they were seen as less of a threat and would often spend several days inside Indian Territory in order to survive the harshness of the land.
Northern colonies (New England)
[
edit
]
An artist's rendition of Native Americans attacking a garrison house in
King Philip's War
Northern Colonies also known as The New England Colonies were made up of the colonies of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Providence Plantations, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. They were part of the Thirteen Colonies. They were mostly associated with the
fur trade
when there was trading and primary traded with the
Pequot Indians
,
[12]
but most relationships were fractured due to disease and land disputes eventually leading to
King Phillips War
in 1675. This war was the single greatest war to occur in seventeenth century Puritan New England and is considered to be the deadliest war in the history of New England.
[16]
King Philip's War began the development of a greater European American identity. Which fractured almost all economic activity between English colonists and the Indians in the Area.
Southern colonies
[
edit
]
Indian trade in the southern colonies encompassed the regions of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. The slave trade of Native Americans was common among southern colonies and Florida in the 1600s and early 1700s, but especially in the
American Southeast
. Most people associate Africans with the only people who were enslaved in the Americas however, in most of the southeastern colonies Native American slaves, at times, outnumbered those of African descent. Natives were sometimes used as labor on plantations or as servants. They were also used as interpreters for European traders. In many cases the colonists would trade with Native Americans; giving them goods and weapons, such as the musket, in exchange for beaver pelt and the capturing of other natives from rival tribes to be sold into slavery. This trade of slaves was not a very self-sustaining or an economic venture because either the native population was being wiped out and those who were not being killed or captured became the captors; and as the population of natives available for capture dwindled then the captors began to fall into debt with the colonists whom they were trading with. It was this debt and frustration that began the
Yamasee
War of 1715, which would ultimately be the demise of the trade system in the Carolina's.
The English traders
[
edit
]
The English tradesman followed well established French trading routes throughout the Midwest Colonies traded for fur, tools such as buckets, axes, hammers, etc. They were usually welcomed by the Indians after these trade routes had been established, they often provided shelter, food, or even protection for other foreign Indian Tribes. As trading posts were established trade furthered with the tradesman and Indians. As traders pushed into new frontiers and unexplored areas of the New World, some resistance was met as they encountered new tribes.
Trade with the early United States
[
edit
]
The years following the formation of the United States, the US government began to regulate the trade industry with the
Indian Intercourse Act
, which was passed on July 22, 1790. For the first time, The United States regulated trade with the
Native Americans
. The government established an agency called The
Bureau of Indian Affairs
which was responsible for issuing licences to trade in the
Indian Territory
.
[17]
Because of the increasing movement west in the
United States
, more and more
Native Americans
were being pushed off of their native lands and deeper into the
Western United States
. Wars continued to break out such as
Tecumseh's War
that was a conflict between the
United States Army
and a
Native American
confederacy
and that ultimately developed into the
War of 1812
.
[18]
These wars with the native population damaged relations between the Indians and the
United States
. During this time period large and small fur companies began to spring up across America. The
American Fur Company
,
[19]
which was established in 1808, was one of the largest trading companies in the United States. As the 1800s continued on fur became less popular as the
fashion trends
began to shift. The Native American economy relied heavily on goods received from the fur trade and when it slowed they had to turn to other sources to continue receiving goods that they needed. The Native Americans began to sell off their land to settlers in oftentimes forced situations. These tense deals lead to future armed conflicts.
Trade with Southern Indians
[
edit
]
Map showing the displacement of Native Americans
Most of the
Native American
tribes of the south were forcefully relocated during the
Indian Removal
in the 1830s. These tribes were relocated to
Indian Territory
which was west of the
Mississippi River
. The
Muscogee
also known as the
Creek
were a
Native American
people located in the southeastern woodlands. This area consisted mostly of
Oklahoma
,
Alabama
,
Georgia
, and
Florida
. The
Muscogee
participated heavily in the deer skin trade. Their main hunting grounds were in
Savannah
and
Florida
. The
Muscogee
that were located more towards the south began to migrate into
Florida
and then later became known as the
Seminoles
. At the beginning of the 19th century conflicts between the
Seminoles
and white settlers became more frequent. By the end of the 19th century more than 3,000
Seminoles
had been relocated and only an estimated 200 to 300 remained in Florida.
[20]
Consequently, trade in the
southern states
came to a halt at the end of this era.
Trade with the West
[
edit
]
In the early 1800s trade with
Native Americans
was already commonplace. Trade with the
Native Americans
in the mid-west states mostly consisted of beaver fur, and in return natives would receive horses, guns, and other commodities that they themselves could not produce. During the
Indian Removal
in this time, many tribes were pushed by the government into western states such as
Kansas
,
Kentucky
, and
Missouri
. The
Shawnee
was one such tribe that was pushed from
Pennsylvania
and into
Ohio
,
Alabama
, and
Illinois
. The
Shawnee
traded fur in exchange for rum or brandy.
Alcohol abuse became
a serious problem within the tribe.
[21]
Another tribe that heavily populated the southern plains region was the Comanche tribe
Annual rendezvous of Rocky Mountain trappers.
Original sketch in Oregon Trail Museum.
Another tribe that heavily populated the southern plains region was the Comanche tribe. The Comanche were mostly farmers before the tribal conflicts over the fur trade that began due to the Europeans. After the fur wars, the Comanches were driven from eastern territories and into the bison hunting territory. By the nineteenth century, the Comanche tribe were mostly nomadic and relying heavily on the hunting of bison to sustain life. Bison fur was also traded with other tribes and with villagers located in the Missouri. Three other tribes that also participated in the bison trade with the Comanche were the Cheyenne, Kiowa and Arapahoes tribes. The four tribes constantly searched for prime buffalo grounds and horse herds that they could trade with the Missouri villagers and the horse reservoir that was located in the south.
[22]
One common source of trading that occurred in the west was through the
Rocky Mountain Rendezvous
.
[23]
The Rendezvous was an annual gathering that took places over a variety of locations. Large fur companies such as the
American Fur Company
would put together mule trains that were loaded with commodities such as whiskey, ammunition, and other supplies that were necessary for life in the West.
Native Americans
were not the only ones to attend these rendezvouses,
mountain men
and trappers would also attend to trade their furs and hides. The Rendezvous was an opportunity for all traders to replenish supply. The rendezvous was an opportunity for trappers and traders to come together and share ideas and to socialize. Natives usually brought their entire families and were viewed as peculiar to the other attendees.
[24]
Trade with the United States 1820-1870
[
edit
]
Conflict with the Native Americans steadily increased during this time period.  The Manifest Destiny attitude of the United States government was reflected in their dealings with tribal nations.  During this era, the
Indian Removal Act of 1830
was passed, leading to the genocide of many eastern Indian tribes.
[25]
The final treaty with Native Americans which was known as
The End of Treating Making 1871
[26]
marked the end of government recognition of Indian tribes and introduced the creation of Indian reservations that continue to the modern day. This absolute disenfranchisement of Native Americans marked the end of any official trading with the United States.
Eastern United States
[
edit
]
The 1830 Indian Removal Act, signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, authorized the President to grant unsettled lands west of the Mississippi River in exchange for Indian lands within existing state borders. Due to the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and the
Second Seminole War
, official trade of commercial goods on the East Coast concluded. By 1839 the Cherokee nation was forced to give up its land and migrate to present day Oklahoma. The Cherokee people called this the
Trail of Tears
due to its devastating affects which left 4,000 out of the 15,000 Cherokees dead.
[27]
Mid-West
[
edit
]
In 1828 Fort Union, located in Upper Missouri was the chief establishment for most fur companies, lone traders like, Wyeth, Bonneville, Pilcher, Fontenelle made it competitive for established fur companies. In 1834 Fur trade was at its height, with half dozen organized companies in the United States competing with the American fur company which during this time had monopolize the fur trade industry in the United States by 1830. Fur companies competing with the American fur company were forced or found it useful to their advantage to utilize the wandering habits of the Indians, having only general rendezvous, most hunters were sent out in different directions. Not having storehouses, hunters would bury their furs until the annual caravan sent out to St. Louis.
[28]
Utah
[
edit
]
The
Ute
nation and
Paiutes
experienced continuous conflict with the Mormon settlers whose lineage could be tracked to the English settlers. Although certain accommodations were arranged with the Mormon settlers, the occupation and abuse of resources and wildlife ultimately exhausted peaceful relationships between the Native Americans and Mormon settlers. The Mormons attempted to suppress the New Mexican trade; which resulted in the disruption of the Ute economy and society. On July 17, 1853, a catastrophic dispute between James Ivie and a couple of Ute members led to a disagreement, which eventually resulted in one of the Ute members being killed. This dispute and many more issues led to the
Walker War
.
[29]
California
[
edit
]
The
California gold rush
was the start of genocide of Native Americans on the west coast. Miners, loggers and settlers formed vigilant groups to hunt Indians who were living outside the mission communities.
[30]
In the year 1845, the population of Native Americans was estimated to be around 150,000 which decreased significantly to 30,000 by 1870.
[31]
This massive decrease in the population was a result of life-threatening and contagious diseases, dwindling of wildlife and resources and constant persecution from the influx of new arrivals which included the English migrants and Europeans.
[32]
United States legislation on commerce with Native Americans
[
edit
]
Articles of Confederation
[
edit
]
Under the Articles of Confederation, there was neither effectiveness nor efficiency when concerning the central government. Under the Articles, Congress didn't have political credibility to pass or enact legislation. For example, Congress didn't have the power to tax, only suggest or request money.
[33]
This led to the consequence of insufficient funds to finance soldiers, bond holders, or regulate a currency. This affected Native Americans in the aspect that they had to go through various obstacles to trade or sell commodities. In addition, without a regulating currency, this could inflate prices on their goods and services. Also, different specie would make transactions more difficult. However, the Articles of Confederation granted regulated trade between the federal government and Native American tribes.
[34]
The Articles of Confederation lack of acknowledging interstate commerce resulted in unnecessary taxes and tariffs between states.
[35]
This affected Native American commerce because they still had to pay taxes, but on a state-by-state basis, which potentially led to a discriminatory tax. Depending on the geographical region, some tribes had disputes and wars with colonists, which led to tense relations.
United States Constitution
[
edit
]
Under the Articles of Confederation, there were no laws or regulations that gave Congress the power to regulate commerce. Thus, the states were in charge or monitoring their own commerce between other states. This proved to be difficult for Native American trading, for there was no unity between the states; each state was its own nation with their own set of rules and regulations, which added even more complications to how Indians were able to operate commerce transactions. However, the Confederation Congress spent a good deal of time and effort developing policies to keep peace between the white settlers and the Native Americans.
[35]
To maintain peace between early colonies and Native Americans, the Confederation Congress were able to raise armies, as well as appoint liaisons to settle insurrections that would occur. Under the new Constitution, framers added the
Commerce Clause
:
(Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3):
[36]
“To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;”
The idea or intention of the framers were to regulate commerce between four forms of sovereignty: Native American tribes, foreign countries, states, and the federal government of the United States. The effects of Constitution ratifications gave more central authority to the federal government over Native Americans tribes through the Trade and Intercourse Acts, as well as Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 (Treaty Clause), and
Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 (Property Clause
[36]
):
The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.
Within the first decade of the ratification of the Constitution, Congress passed The Northwest Ordinance (1785) in the hope of raising federal revenue from the sale of Western land. Under this ordinance, there were demarcation lines of counties and townships up to the discretion of the governor:
Section 8.
[37]
For the prevention of crimes and injuries, the laws to be adopted or made shall have force in all parts of the district, and for the execution of process, criminal and civil, the governor shall make proper divisions thereof; and he shall proceed from time to time as circumstances may require, to lay out the parts of the district in which the Indian titles shall have been extinguished, into counties and townships, subject, however, to such alterations as may thereafter be made by the legislature.
Section 14, Article III
[37]
illustrates the ideal relationship between Native Americans and government:
Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent; and, in their property, rights, and liberty, they shall never be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity, shall from time to time be made for preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace and friendship with them.
Federal involvement
[
edit
]
Johnson v. McIntosh
[38]
proved that the new central government was in favor of sovereign property rights, by stating that private citizens could not purchase Native American land, and that the federal government has the sole right
[39]
to negotiate with tribal nations.
Cherokee Nation v. Georgia
[40]
was a case that stripped away of rights from Cherokee Nation due to the court arguing that the tribe had no original jurisdiction
[41]
because they were a sovereign tribe. Supporters uphold this verdict under Article III of the Constitution.
Worcester v. Georgia
[42]
argued the fundamentals of state government and established boundaries that ensured peace and privacy with the Cherokee Nation. In a 5-1 decision, the court argued in favor of Worcester that the state of Georgia does not have the authority to regulate the intercourse
[43]
between citizens of its state and members of the Cherokee Nation.
In 1830, President Andrew Jackson enacted
The Indian Removal Act
[44]
, in which Native Americans east of the Mississippi were forced to move west of the Mississippi River. The logistics behind it were due to high demand of American settlers wanting to live there.

Zeals
is a village and
civil parish
in southwest
Wiltshire
, England. The village is about 2.2 miles (3.5 km) west of
Mere
, next to the
A303 road
towards
Wincanton
, and adjoins the villages of
Bourton, Dorset
and
Penselwood
, Somerset. Its name comes from the
Old English
sealh
meaning a small
willow
or sallow.
The civil parish includes the hamlets of
Long Cross
,
White Cross
,
Lower Zeals
and
Wolverton
. The
River Stour
forms the west boundary of the parish.
History
[
edit
]
There are no known prehistoric sites within the modern parish. Nearby on the other side of the Stour valley are Pen Pits, a series of small circular pits where
greensand
stone was quarried to make
querns
for hand grinding corn, in the Iron Age, Roman and medieval periods.
[2]
Also here is Orchard Castle or Castle Orchard, the remains of a medieval
motte-and-bailey
fortification.
[3]
[4]
In 1086 the
Domesday Book
recorded two estates at
Sele
:
[5]
Lower Zeals (later the Manor of Zeals, or Clevedon) and Higher Zeals (later Zeals Aylesbury). Estimates suggest a population of around 40-50 at Lower Zeals and 85-95 at Higher Zeals at that time.
[6]
Zeals was anciently a
tithing
of
Mere
parish
[7]
but was made a separate civil parish in 1896.
[8]
A school was provided in 1846, and a larger building erected in 1874 on a site northeast of the church. By 1911 there were 31 infants and 50 older children. A classroom was added in the 1950s, and in 1955 the school gained
voluntary controlled
status. The village school at Stourton closed in 1965 and pupils transferred to Zeals. New school buildings opened in 1975, immediately north of the old school.
[9]
There was a second school, opened in 1840 by
Congregationalists
at Winbrook, south of Zeals village, and intended for children from Bourton and Penselwood as well as Zeals. When a new Congregational chapel was built in 1856 the school moved into the old chapel, in the same area, and around that time became a
British School
. Early in the 20th century it was taken over by Wiltshire Council and became Winbrook School. In 1907 there were 70 pupils, but numbers later fell and in 1932 the 41 children transferred to the church school.
[10]
The A303 trunk road, taking traffic from London via
Andover
to
Wincanton
and the southwest, passed through the village
[11]
until 1992, when it was diverted to the south.
[6]
Notable buildings
[
edit
]
Zeals House, west side
Zeals House at Lower Zeals (east of Zeals village) is a
Grade I listed
former manor house with a 14th-century range. It was owned by the Chafyn family, later the Chafyn-Groves, from the 15th century until the mid 20th. Additions were made in the 17th century and the 1860s, resulting in a large L-shaped country house having a tower with battlemented parapet, one-and-a-half storeys above the rest.
[12]
In 2001, the ten-bedroom house was sold for £2.4
million.
[13]
Four associated buildings are Grade II listed: the small orangery, mid 18th century;
[14]
the stable block and carriage house, brick, probably late 18th century;
[15]
a small square dovecote in rubble stone under a pyramidal tiled roof, of similar date;
[16]
and the granary, early 19th century, in light timber frame and brick.
[17]
There are lodges at two entrances to the grounds: a pair of small square buildings at the north entrance,
[18]
and a two-storey stone house dated 1878 at the south.
[19]
Zeals has a set of
Tudor revival
-style
almshouses
that were built in 1865 for William Chafyn-Grove.
[20]
Together with the parish hall, they are Grade II listed.
[21]
Church and chapels
[
edit
]
St Martin's Church
The
Church of England parish church
of
Saint Martin
was built using local limestone in 1842-44, to
decorated gothic
designs by the
Gothic Revival architect
George Gilbert Scott
; it is among his earlier works.
[20]
Money was raised by Rev. William Frederick Grove, a relative of the Groves of Zeals House,
[22]
and the Duke of Somerset provided the land.
[23]
The church was consecrated on 14 October 1846 as a
chapel of ease
of the parish of
Mere
, then on 27 June 1848 Zeals was made a separate
ecclesiastical parish
and St. Martin's became the parish church.
[23]
In 1876, Julia Chafyn Grove gave money for fittings including the organ, reredos and five of the bells,
[22]
and for the addition of a spire to the tower.
[23]
The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1966.
[24]
The benefice was united with
Stourton
in 1963,
[25]
and today the church is part of the parish of Upper Stour, alongside
Bourton
,
Kilmington
and Stourton.
[22]
Zeals had a
Congregational
chapel from 1832 to 1980
[26]
and a
Methodist
chapel from 1852 to 1973.
[27]
Amenities
[
edit
]
Whitesheet Church of England Primary Academy, near the church in Zeals village, serves the parish and surrounding area. Since 2003 it has operated on two sites, with younger children attending the school at
Kilmington
and older children at Zeals.
[9]
The village has a
pub
, the Bell and Crown.
[28]
The
Monarch's Way
long-distance footpath passes through Zeals and Wolverton, and the
Stour Valley Way
crosses the far west of the parish.
Notable people
[
edit
]
Notable members of the Grove family at Zeals House include
William Chaffin Grove
(c. 1731-1793), lawyer and
Member of Parliament
for
Shaftesbury
, and later for the
Weymouth and Melcombe Regis
seat.
[29]
A later William Chafyn Grove built the 1865 almshouses as a memorial to his mother.
[21]
His sister Julia Chafyn Grove (d. 1897) provided Zeals village hall in 1888; her other philanthropy included paying for the building of a school at Mere. She left money for education in
Salisbury
which resulted in the naming of
Chafyn Grove School
in 1916.
[30]
Herbert Holman, first husband of actress
Vivien Leigh
, bought Manor Farmhouse (near Zeals House) soon after their divorce in 1940; Leigh often visited him and their daughter Suzanne there. The property was inherited by the daughter (by then
Suzanne Farrington
) after his death in 1982, and she lived there until her death in 2015.
[31]
Zeals airfield
[
edit
]
Main article:
RAF Zeals
North of Zeals village, next to the village of
Stourton
and the
Stourhead estate
, is the site of the former
RAF Zeals
, also known as
HMS Hummingbird
and
RNAS Zeals
.  The airfield operated between May 1942 and June 1946, and during this short time was used by the
Royal Air Force
, the
United States Army Air Forces
and the
Royal Navy
.
[32]
Until August 1943
RAF Fighter Command
used it as a fighter airfield for
Hurricanes
and
Spitfires
.
[32]
The station was transferred in August 1943 to the USAAF whose initial plan was to use the airfield to maintain
C-47 Skytrain
transport aircraft. However, the damp conditions prevented heavy loads so
P-47 Thunderbolt
fighter aircraft were flown from Zeals instead. From March 1944 the airfield reverted to the RAF who posted
Mosquito
there to intercept incoming German bombers.  Following
D-Day
the RAF used the airfield for glider training in preparation for action against Japan, and in April 1945 the airfield was transferred to the Royal Navy, and was commissioned
HMS Heron
using the airfield for
aircraft carrier
training.
The airfield closed on 1 January 1946, although the RN stayed until June 1946 when it was returned to farmland.  As of 2006, the control tower, now a private house, remains on Bells Lane in Zeals.
A memorial stands at nearby Beech Knoll in Stourton to mark the site where an RAF transport plane crashed on 19 February 1945, killing 21 on board.
[33]
The plane had taken off from Zeals airfield to return to Leicester after two weeks of glider training and flew into cloud-covered beech trees on the knoll.

Biography
[
edit
]
Makoto Fukami was born in
Kumamoto Prefecture
on August 5, 1977.
[1]
In 1999, Fukami created the
manga
Wild Diamond
, which won the
Famitsu Entertainment Award
[
ja
]
for manga in that year.
[1]
In 2005, he launched his first major novel series,
Young Gun Carnaval
.
[2]

screenwriter
for various
anime
series with
Psycho-Pass
.
[3]
In 2013, the manga series
The Torture Club
received a
live action
film adaptation.
[4]
Later that year, in the

General characteristics
Class and type
Oil tanker
Odyssey
, which previously went by the name
Oriental Phoenix
, was an oil tanker in operation from 1971 to November 10, 1988, when an explosion caused it to sink in the
North Atlantic
off the coast of
Canada
.
[1]
The resulting spill remains one of the largest
oil spills
in world history. The tanker was 700 nautical miles (1,300 km; 810 mi) off the coast of the Canadian province of
Nova Scotia
when it sank and released 132,157 tons (43 million gallons) of oil into the ocean,
[2]
[3]
valued at some $86.7 million (2010).
[4]
By way of comparison, 4 times as much oil was spilled by the
Odyssey
as from the much more famous
Exxon Valdez
.
Sinking
[
edit
]
Built in 1971, this 65,000-ton tanker was operated by
Polembros Shipping Ltd.
of
London
,
England
, and registered in
Liberia
. In 1988, the ship had been newly sold to the Diamond Port Shipping Corporation and renamed the Odyssey
.
[5]
On November 5, 1988, the tanker departed
Sullom Voe Terminal
in the
Shetland Islands
off
Scotland
, fully loaded with
North Sea
Brent Crude oil
which was being transported to the
Come By Chance Refinery
at
Come-by-Chance
,
Newfoundland and Labrador
.
When the ship was about 1000
nautical miles
off the coast of Newfoundland, a major
North Atlantic
storm arose, buffeting the ship with 25-foot (7.6 m) waves and 44-mile-per-hour winds.
[6]
In response, the ship sent out a distress signal and kept heading for shore. The distress call was received by
Radio Valentia
in Ireland and transferred to the
Canadian Rescue Coordination Centre
.
[7]
The centre alerted the vessels in the area.
However, when the ship was 700 nautical miles (1,300 km) off the coast of Nova Scotia, an explosion occurred on board, causing the ship to break into two and begin sinking. As the ship sank, a fire broke out on its stern section, causing the oil on board to catch fire.
[8]
A Russian weather ship, the
Passat
, responded to the Odyssey's distress call and was on site in less than an hour, travelling 26 miles to the scene.
[9]
Once on site, however, it was unable to approach within one mile of the vessel, which was surrounded by ignited oil slicks.
[9]
All 27 crew members, 15 Greeks and 12 Hondurans, are presumed to have died during the incident. Because of hazardous weather conditions, the
Canadian Coast Guard
could not immediately reach the spill and much of the oil burned up before the coast guard reached the ship.
[10]
A
Canadian Forces
plane that flew over the area before nightfall
[7]
reported that the stern section had sunk, the bow section was just at the surface at that time,
[7]
and the fire had died out.
[9]
Environmental effects
[
edit
]
In the immediate aftermath of the ship's sinking, the oil spill covered an area of 3 miles (4.8 km) x 10 miles (16 km).
[1]
A much reduced amount of oil reached shore - in part because of the oil's rapid combustion from the initial explosion and in part because currents carried the spill across the Atlantic, in the direction of England, giving the oil a significant amount of time to dissipate in the rough seas.
[11]
Because of this, no clean-up operation was mounted.
[12]
The Advisory Committee on Marine Pollution of the Sea of the
International Council for the Exploration of the Sea
published an analysis of the spill in their
1990 Marine Pollution Yearbook
which noted that the spill likely had a significant effect on
krill
in the area, and through them, may have affected animals further up the
food chain
.

La Scala

Charity work
[

In 1993, Eduardo, the first son of Ramón Vargas and his wife, was born in a hospital in Italy. Unfortunately, due to the negligence of the doctors attending the childbirth, the baby suffered a
hypoxic encephalopathy
, causing a nonreversible injury to his brain. During the following few months doctors in Europe and the United States confirmed a hopeless prognosis of brain paralysis, in the degree of
quadriplegia
. In the beginning of January 2000, Eduardo's life reached its end.
Nonetheless, his parents decided that they did not wish to isolate themselves from their experience, on the contrary, they chose to perpetuate the memory and the example of Eduardo to help other special children like him, by setting up the Eduardo Vargas Memorial Fund.
The creation and basic aims of the memorial fund were publicly announced by means of a gala concert with Ramón Vargas and the young American
soprano
Noëlle Richardson, accompanied on the piano by Mzia Bachtouridze, at the villa of the Rothschild Foundation in
Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat
, on 1 July 2000.
The initial proceeds were channeled through Vamos, a foundation with large experience in social development activities amongst the most vulnerable population in Mexico, towards some programmes of support that cover the following aspects:
Training promoters and community therapists
Providing information and support to the parents of children with special needs
Giving direct attention to disabled children and young people.
In addition to contributions made by friends and generous anonymous donors, the Eduardo Vargas Memorial Fund is supported by the proceeds from concerts performed by Ramón Vargas.

The
Nidhanpur copperplate inscription
of the 7th-century
Kamarupa
king
Bhaskaravarman
gives a detailed account of land grants given to
Brahmins
. It records land grants to more than two hundred
vaidika
brahmanas belonging to 56
gotras
.
[1]
The copper plates were found mostly in
Panchakhanda pargana
where, according to historians, the actual granted lands were located. This
Sanskrit
inscription contains the names of donees which are more than two hundred in numbers.
The inscriptions recorded by Bhaskaravarman in different parts of
India
provide a detailed account of his rule and associate events. It was customary among the kings of Kamarupa to issue seals for every major event related to the kingdom be they giving land grants to Brahmins or winning a war.
Discovery
[
edit
]
The copper plates were discovered on 29 December 1912, in the village of
Nidhanpur
in
Panchakhanda
near
Sylhet
,
Bangladesh
. They were discovered by a cultivator during the process of building a buffalo shed. Thinking that they were a clue to the location of a hidden treasure, he took the plates to a local landholder who recognised them for what they were and brought them to the attention of authorities in
Silchar
in present-day
Assam
,
India
.
[2]
Translation
[
edit
]
The following is the translation of the inscription by
Padmanath Bhattacharya Vidya Vinod
:
[2]
Om. (Verse 1.)   Having saluted the god who is lovely with the moon as head-gear. the wielder of the bow (pinaka), adorned  with  particles of ashes, I once again make clear (what was already)  plain words (i.e. of the destroyed plates) for the benefit of the (spiritually) prosperous Brahmans.
(Line 2.)  Hail. From the camp located at Karnasuvarna, with the appropriate epithet of victory owing to possession of splendid ships, elephants horses and foot-soldiers.
(V.2.) Victorious is the form of the great Lord (Mahadeva), never forsaken (in contemplation by the
devotees), bedecked with its own splendour, that has a girdle made of the lord of snakes, (and) that destroyed
the body of Kama (Cupid) at a mere glance.
(V.3.) Victorious is (also) Dharma (Religion), the sole friend of the creation, the cause of prosperity in both the worlds (this and the next), whose form is the good of others, unseen (yet) whose existence is inferred from the results.
(V.4.) Naraka, the chief of the rulers of the earth, was the son of the wielder of the Chakra	(i.e. Vishnu),
who with a view to lift up the Earth from (beneath) the Ocean, assumed the distinguished form of a boar.
(V.5.) From that
Naraka
, by whom naraka (hell) was never seen, was born king Bhagadatta, the friend of Indra, who challenged in fight Vijaya (i.e. Arjuna), renowned for conquests.
(V.6.) Of that killer of (his) enemies	(there) was a son named Vajradatta whose course was like (that of) the thunderbolt (Vajra), who with an army of uninterrupted progress always pleased in  fight the performer of hundred sacrifices (i.e. Indra).
(V.7.) When the kings of his family having enjoyed the position (of rulers) for three thousand years had (all)  attained  the  condition  or gods,
Pushyavarman
became the lord of the world.
(V.8.) His son was Samudravarman,  who was like a fifth samudra (Ocean), during whose reign there was no anarchy, shining with gems, and quick in duels.
(V.9.) That king had a son born of (his queen) Dattadevi, (named)
Balavarman
, whose force and armour never broke up and whose army would easily marchagainst enemies.
(V.10.) His son born of (queen) Ratnavati was the king named Kalayanavarman, who was not the abode of even very small faults.
(V.11.) From him (queen) Gandharvavati begot a son Ganapati (by name) who was incessantly raining gifts as (the god) Ganapati (rains) ichor, who was endowed with innumerable qualities, for the extermination of strife (as Ganapati) is born to destroy the Kali age.
(V.12.) His queen Yajnavati, brought forth a son Mahendravarman, as the sacrificial fire (produces) fire,
who was the repository of all sacrificial rites (like fire).
( V.13.) From him who mastered his self, Suvrata generated a son Narayanavarman for the stability (of the
rule; of the world, who like Janaka (or his father) was well versed in the principles of the philosophy of the (supreme) Self.
(V.14.) From him, Devavati, like Prakriti from Purusha, bore Mahabhutavarman, the sixth Mahabhuta (element) as it were, for the steady succession of (all) the properties.
(V.15.) His son was Chandramukha, who was charming by (possessing) all the arts as the moon (by the digits), whom Vijnanavati brought forth, as the Sky did (the moon), a dispeller of (all) gloom(as the moon dispels the darkness).
(V.16.) Thereafter (queen) Bhogavati of (good) enjoyment became the cause (of birth) of Sthitavarman, the supporter of the world, who had innumerable (sources of) enjoyment, (just as) Bhogavati (the city of the Snakes of the nether regions) is (the source) of prosperity of the chief of the Snakes, the supporter of the earth, who has a myriad of hoods.
(V.17.) From that king of unfathomable nature, of innumerable gems, and the spouse of the (goddess) Lakshmi, was born Sri-Mriganka, who had no blemish, just as the moon, free from spots, is born from the milky ocean, whose substance is unfathomable, whose pearls cannot be counted, and from which Lakshmi was produced.
(V.18.) His (i.e. Sthitavarman's) son king Susthitavarman was born of Nayanadevi, he who held the kingdom in his own hand, and was renowned as Sri Mriganka.
(V.19.) By whom was given away to supplicants as if it were (a clod of) earth, that shining Lakshmi (i.e. wealth) whom (god) Hari like a miser bears with joy in his bosom.
(V.20.) From him Syamadevi,(divine) like that goddess (Syama) of the Krita (i.e. golden) age, generated a son Supratishthitavarman, the moon as it were to dispel (all) gloom.
(V.21.) Whose prosperity was for the benefit of others, who was possessed of elephants and attended by the chief among the learned, and possessed of a well established capital like a kulachala,  whose height is for the benefit of others, which  is haunted by the chief of Vidyadharas, is rich in elephants, and has a ridge.
(V.22.) The same Syamadevi also brought forth his younger brother Sri-Bhaskaravarman, who like the sun was of incalculable rime and the abode of all light.
(V. 23.) Who though being only one, is, on account of his character, much and simultaneously reflected in the hearts of people, pure like mirrors turned toward, him.
(V.24.) Whose mark (i.e. picture) was seen in the houses of kings, untarnished on account of great lustre, like the disc of the sun in several water pots.
(V.25.) Who is without cruelty, easily accessible, of immense effects, and the soles of whose feet are surrounded by people who resort to his protection, like the wish-yielding tree which holds no snakes, which is well growing, abounds in rich fruits, and whose roots are surrounded by people who want shade.
(Lines 34-44.) Moreover he (Bhaskaravarman, who has been) created by the hold lotus-born (god), the a same of the rise, the arranging and the destruction of the Universe, for the proper organization of the duties of
(various) castes and stages (of life) that had become mixed up; who by (his) rise has made the circle of
(related) powers become attached like the Lord of the World (the Sun), whose disc becomes coloured when it rises; who has revealed the light of the Arya religion by dispelling the accumulated darkness of (this) Kali age
by making is judicious application of his revenues (like the sun that dispels the accumulated darkness in the Kali age by spreading the mass of its pleasant rays), who has equalled the prowess of the whole ring of his feudatories by the strength of his own arum ; who has devised many a way of enjoyment for his hereditary
subjects, whose (loyal) devotion (to him) was augmented by his steadiness (of purpose), modesty and affability ; who is adorned with a wonderful ornament of splendid fame made of the flowery words of praise variously composed by hundreds of kings vanquished by him in battle; whose virtuous activities, like (those of) Sivi were applied in making gifts for the benefit of others; whose powers, as (of) a second preceptor of the gods (Brihaspati), were recognised by other; on account of (his) skill in dividing and applying the means of politics that appear in suitable moments; whose own conduct was adorned by learning, valour, patience, prowess and good actions ; who was avoided by faults as if they were overcome on account of (his) taking to the other (i.e. Virtue's) side ; by whom the Lakshmis (deities of luck) of Kamrarupa were, as it were, attracted with a staunch incessant excessive passion of love; to whom was exhibited, with a fast embrace, the course of love for the abhigamikagunas (by the Lakshmi of Kamarupa drawn by an excessive sentiment of constant affection) who is, as it were, the breath of the holy Dharma whose person has been seized by the powerful Kali (Iron Age), the abode of politics and good qualities, the receptacle of friends, the shelter of the terrified, the abode of good luck, whose dignified power was shown by the elevated rank obtained in order of succession from (Naraka) the son of Vasumati (Earth), the king of kings, the illustrious  Bhaskaravarman, in sound health, commands the present and the future district officers, as well as the courts of justice in thri district of Chandrapuri (thus): 
let it be known to you (all) that the land of the Mayurasalamalgraha (grant to the Brahmanas) lying within this district, granted (earlier) by issuing a copper-plate charter by king Bhutivarman has become liable to revenue on account of the loss of the copper-plates. So by the Maharaja (Bhaskaravarman), having informed the senior respectable persons and having issued orders for making a fresh copper plate grant, the land has been awarded to the Porahmanas, who have been already enjoying the grant, in the manner of Bhumi-chidra, so that no tax is levied on it as long as the sun, the moon and the earth will endure. Here the names of the Brahmanas (i.e., donees) areas follows: (lines 34 to 54)
Seven shares (amsah) are (allotted) for the purpose of bali (worship), care (oblation) and satra (hospitality). The produce of the land, found as an extension (due to the drying up) of the Kausika river, wide go to the Brahmanas, the donees of the grant but the land, found as an extension (due to the drying up) of the Gangini shall be equally shared by the Porahmanas as recorded. These are the boundaries: to the east lies the dry Kausika, to the south-west, that very dry Kausika, marked by a hewn fig tree, to the west now the boundary of Gangini, to the north west a potter's pit, and the said Gangini, sent westward, to the north a large, jatali tree; to the north-east the pond of the controlling tradesman Khasoka, and the dry Kausika. The officer issuing hundred commands in Sri Gopala who has received the five great sadbas. The officers who mark the boundaries are the headman of the Chandrapuri (named Sri Ksikunda, the dispute-settler (nyayakaranika) Janardanasvanin, the controlling officer (Vyarahari) Haradtta and the clerk (Kayastha) Dundunatha, and others. The composer and writer of the grant is Vasuvarma. The master of the treasury is the Mahasamanta Divakaraprabha. Tax-collector is Dattakarapurna. The copper-smith (i.e., the maker of the plates) is Kaliya. (lines 126-136)
The giver of land rejoices in heaven for sixty-thousand years and he who confiscates or assents (to confiscation) lives in hell for the same period. (v. 26) One who confiscate the land given by himself or by others, becomes work of the fifth and rots with the manes. (v. 27)
Since after the burning of the plates, these newly written letters are (obviously) different in form (from the letters of the earlier grant) they are not (to be respected as) forged.' (v. 28)

Ditema tsa Dinoko
(
Sesotho
for "Ditema syllabary"), also known as Ditema tsa sesotho. In
IsiZulu
it is referred to as,
isiBheqe soHlamvu
, and various other related names in different languages,
[1]
[2]
is a
constructed writing system
(specifically, a
featural
syllabary
) for the
siNtu
or
Southern Bantu languages
(for example, for
Sesotho
,
Setswana
,
IsiZulu
,
IsiXhosa
,
SiSwati
,
SiPhuthi
,
Xitsonga
,
EMakhuwa
,
ChiNgoni
,
SiLozi
, or
Tshivenḓa
), developed in the 2010s from antecedent
ideographic
traditions of the Southern African region. Its visual appearance is inspired by these, including the traditional
litema
arts style.
[3]
It was developed between 2014 and 2016 by a group of South African linguists and software programmers with the goal of creating a denser writing system to avoid the slowness in reading caused by the word length and visual homogeneity of
Southern Bantu languages
written in the Roman alphabet.
[4]
[5]
The Ditema / Isibheqe syllabary has the capacity to represent the full phonological range of these
sintu
languages (in the
Nguni
,
Sotho-Tswana
,
Venḓa
,
Tsonga
and
Tonga-Inhambane
groups) consistently under one
orthography
.
[6]
This includes languages that are unstandardised in the
Latin alphabet
such as the
East Sotho languages
(Sepulana, Sekutswe and Hipai), or the
Tekela languages
, which, with the exception of
SiSwati
, are not official languages. Orthographic support for these languages is for instance evidenced in the
ingungwana
grapheme
, which indicates
vowel nasality
— a feature of Tekela languages.
Ditema tsa Dinoko
in a stylized script, read left-to-right. The three syllables of first word are clustered, with the third syllable on the bottom
Description
[
edit
]
The script operates as a
syllabary
, as each freestanding symbol represents a
syllable
, with
graphemes
for consonant and vowel sounds combined into syllable blocks (
amabheqe
), in a similar fashion to
Hangeul
. When the syllable being represented is not a
syllabic nasal
, these symbols are formed from a triangular or
chevron-shaped
grapheme representing the
nucleus
of the syllable, with the attached
ongwaqa
or consonant graphemes representing the
onset
of the syllable or its mode of articulation.
[7]
Syllabic nasals are represented as circles that fill the whole
ibheqe
or syllable block.
The construction of the syllables of three words in different languages: <Xilo> [ʃiːlɔ] "thing" in Xitsonga, <Vhathu> [βaːtʰu] "people" in Tshivenḓa, <Ho tlêtse> [hʊt͜ɬ’ɛːt͜s’ɪ] "It is full" in Sesotho.
Vowels
[
edit
]
The vowel graphemes (
onkamisa
) form the basis of each
ibheqe
or syllable block, as the nucleus of each syllable, with the
ongwaqa
or consonant graphemes positioned in and around them.
The direction of each
ibheqe
indicates the quality of the vowel for each of the seven vowel
phonemes
:
Intombi
, the upward facing triangle: /i/
Isoka
, the downward facing triangle: /a/
Umkhonto
, the upward facing chevron: /u/
The leftward facing triangle: /ɛ/
The rightward facing triangle: /ɔ/
The leftward facing chevron: /e/
The rightward facing chevron: /o/
There is an eighth "vowel" represented by the downward facing chevron, which is an
empty vowel
, and is mostly used for foreign words to represent a standalone consonant, often as a
syllable coda
, which does not occur in siNtu languages having CV phonology.
The apex of the triangle or chevron corresponds to vowel height or frontedness, with
high vowels
/i/ and /u/ pointing upwards and the
low vowel
/a/ pointing downwards. Likewise, the
front vowels
/ɛ/ and /e/ point leftwards and the
back vowels
/ɔ/ and /o/ point rightwards.
Vowel nasality is indicated with the
ingungwana
grapheme, which is a solid dot outside the triangle separated from the apex, as in the word
phãsi
below:
English
down/below
Zunda
phansi
pʰaːntsʼi
Tekela
phãsi
pʰãːsi
Consonants
[
edit
]
Consonants (
ongwaqa
) are composed of one or more graphemes. At least one of these indicates the place and manner of articulation. If more than one such consonant grapheme is superimposed, this represents a co-articulation, e.g. an
affricate
(formed of superimposed stop and fricative graphemes), or an
onset cluster
. Other overlaid dots and strokes indicate articulatory mode, whether that be
voiced
,
prenasalised
,
implosive
,
ejective
,
modal voice
, or a combination thereof.
The position of the consonant graphemes largely corresponds to the
place of articulation
:
Labials
and
nasals
are positioned outside the triangle at the apex.
Alveolars
are across the middle of the triangle from side to side.
Velars
and
palatals
are at the base.
Laterals
are outside the triangle on one side.
Dentals
are two lines across the triangle from side to side, parallel to each other.
The shape of the consonant grapheme corresponds to the
manner of articulation
:
Curved lines indicate
fricatives
.
Their straight line counterparts in the same positions indicate
plosives
.
Approximants
and
trills
are represented with two lines either parallel or at a right angle to each other, with a
tap or flap
being the latter arrangement, one line bisecting the other at its centrepoint without crossing it.
Retroflex
whistled consonants and
postalveolar
fricatives are represented as loops.
Nasals
are represented as circles at the apex of the triangle. Lines inside the circles distinguish the nasals from each other.
Clicks
are a bottomless hourglass shape.
Affricates
are spelled by placing both the corresponding stop and fricative graphemes in the triangle.  Onset clusters use the same technique.
Syllabic laterals and trills are represented with duplication of the ordinary lateral and trill graphemes.
Syllabic nasals or
amaqanda
are unique in that they occupy the entire
ibheqe
space as circles. They are distinguished from each other with lines inside them that operate according to the same principles as above.
These graphemes can combine with each other in an order in accordance with the
phonotactics
of sintu languages, and they also can combine with the articulatory mode graphemes.
Articulatory mode
[
edit
]
There are three graphemic markers of articulatory mode:
For unvoiced consonants, a solid dot within the triangle indicates a glotallised (
ejected
) consonant or a modal click consonant.
For voiced consonants the solid dot inside the triangle indicates an
implosive
consonant or, in the case of languages where there are no implosives, a modal consonant.
The absence of the dot indicates
breathy voice
in the case of voiced consonants, and
aspiration
in the case of voiceless consonants.
Uphimbo
, or the voicing line, running from the apex of the triangle to the base (or until inline with the ends of the chevron), indicates consonant
voicing
.
If the voicing line occurs as the only
ungwaqa
in the
ibheqe
, it indicates a
voiced glottal fricative
/ɦ/.
In languages that distinguish between breathy voiced and modal nasals/trills, the voicing line indicates breathy voice when occurring with these consonant graphemes.
Prenasalised consonants
are marked with an open circle at the apex of the triangle called
ingungu
. These occur with other consonant graphemes, and are distinct from the
bilabial nasal
/m/ that occurs on its own. No additional lines need be added to the
ingungu
when it occurs with other
ongwaqa
as the place of articulation is given by them and need not be marked in the nasal grapheme.
For clicks, the
ingungu
marks a
nasal click consonant
, with the prenasalised clicks (e.g. <nkq>) requiring the addition of a solid dot (glottalisation), in which case the
ingungu
denotes prenasalisation.

Sue Turton
(born c.1966) is a British
television
journalist.
Career
[
edit
]
Sue Turton began her national television career as a reporter in the features department at
Sky News
. She went on to freelance for
LWT
and
MTV
before getting a correspondent's job at the new breakfast programme
GMTV
. She covered the north of England, landing an exclusive with the whistle-blower in the
Bruce Grobbelaar football scandal
. She went back to
freelancing
in 1997 with Sky and
ITV
before joining
Channel 4 News
in 1998. She worked for the programme as both presenter and correspondent for 12 years. Sue won
RTS Awards
and covered different disciplines, including sports news, breaking stories, investigations and foreign affairs.
After leaving Channel 4, she moved to become Al Jazeera's first Afghanistan correspondent. Ten months later she was transferred to the
Middle East
to report on the
Arab Spring
.
[1]
She covered the uprisings in
Libya
,
Syria
and Egypt. She has worked extensively for the channel in Iraq and Lebanon.
In 2015 she was one of several
Al Jazeera journalists convicted in Egypt
of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation. The journalists received sentences of between seven and ten years. Turton, who was tried
in absentia
, led the campaign to have her three imprisoned colleagues freed. They were successful in doing this, but most of their convictions still stand.
[1]
Turton was forced to leave her job with Al Jazeera in June 2015 following her conviction, as it had required her to travel to countries that had extradition treaties with Egypt. She now produces and directs documentaries for channels all over the world. Her latest projects include films on the Paris attacks,
Abu Sayyaf
in the
Philippines
and school street brawls in
Indonesia

Undead creature from folklore
For other uses, see
Vampire (disambiguation)
.
The Vampire
, by
Philip Burne-Jones
, 1897
A
vampire
is a
mythical creature
that subsists by feeding on the
vital essence
(generally in the form of
blood
) of the living. In
European folklore
, vampires are
undead creatures
that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. They wore
shrouds
and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century. Vampiric entities have been
recorded in cultures around the world
; the term
vampire
was popularized in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century
mass hysteria
of a pre-existing folk belief in
Southeastern
and
Eastern Europe
that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism. Local variants in Southeastern Europe were also known by different names, such as
shtriga
in
Albania
,
vrykolakas
in
Greece
and
strigoi
in
Romania
.
In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures (such as the
chupacabra
) still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of
decomposition
after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalize this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death.
Porphyria
was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.
[1]
The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "
The Vampyre
" by the English writer
John Polidori
; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.
Bram Stoker
's 1897 novel
Dracula
is remembered as the quintessential
vampire novel
and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after fellow Irish author
Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu
's 1872 novel
Carmilla
. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire
genre
, still popular in the 21st century, with books,
films
, television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the
horror
genre.
Etymology and word distribution
The term "vampire" is the earliest recorded in English, Latin and French and they refer to vampirism in Russia, Poland and North Macedonia.
[2]
The
English
term was derived (possibly via
French
vampyre
) from the
German
Vampir
, in turn derived in the early 18th century from the
Serbian
вампир
(
vampir
).
[3]
[4]
[5]
The Serbian form has parallels in virtually all
Slavic
and
Turkic
languages:
Bulgarian
and
Macedonian
вампир
(
vampir
),
Turkish
:
Ubır, Obur, Obır
,
Tatar language
:
Убыр
(
Ubır
),
Chuvash language
:
Вупăр
(
Vupăr
),
Bosnian
:
вампир
(
vampir
),
Croatian
vampir
,
Czech
and
Slovak
upír
,
Polish
wąpierz
, and (perhaps
East Slavic
-influenced)
upiór
,
Ukrainian
упир
(
upyr
),
Russian
упырь
(
upyr'
),
Belarusian
упыр
(
upyr
), from
Old East Slavic
упирь
(
upir'
) (many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as "vampir/wampir" subsequently from the West; these are distinct from the original local words for the creature). The exact
etymology
is unclear.
[6]
[7]
In
Albanian
the words
lu(v)gat
and
dhampir
are used; the latter seems to be derived from the
Gheg Albanian
words
dham
'tooth' and
pir
'to drink'.
[8]
[7]
The origin of the modern word Vampire (
Upiór
means
Hortdan
, Vampire or
Witch
in
Turkic
and
Slavic
myths.) comes from the term Ubir-Upiór, the origin of the word Ubir or Upiór is based on the regions around the
Volga (Itil) River
and
Pontic steppes
. Upiór myht is through the migrations of the
Kipchak
-
Cuman
people to the
Eurasian steppes
allegedly spread. The modern word "Vampire" is derived from the
Old Slavic
and
Turkic
languages form "онпыр (onpyr)", with the addition of the "v" sound in front of the large nasal vowel (on), characteristic of Old Bulgarian. The Bulgarian format is впир (vpir). (other names: onpyr, vopir, vpir, upir, upierz.)
[9]
[10]
Czech linguist
Václav Machek
proposes Slovak verb
vrepiť sa
'stick to, thrust into', or its hypothetical anagram
vperiť sa
(in Czech, the archaic verb
vpeřit
means 'to thrust violently') as an etymological background, and thus translates
upír
as 'someone who thrusts, bites'.
[11]
The term was introduced to German readers by the Polish Jesuit priest
Gabriel Rzączyński
in 1721.
[12]
An early use of the
Old Russian
word is in the anti-
pagan
treatise "Word of Saint Grigoriy" (Russian
Слово святого Григория
), dated variously to the 11th-13th centuries, where pagan worship of
upyri
is reported.
[13]
[14]
The word
vampire
(as
vampyre
) first appeared in English in 1732, in news reports about vampire "epidemics" in eastern Europe.
[15]
[a]
After Austria gained control of northern
Serbia
and
Oltenia
with the
Treaty of Passarowitz
in 1718, officials noted the local practice of
exhuming
bodies and "killing vampires".
[17]
These reports, prepared between 1725 and 1732, received widespread publicity.
[17]

List of vampiric creatures in folklore
The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the
Mesopotamians
,
Hebrews
,
Ancient Greeks
,
Manipuri
and
Romans
had tales of
demons
and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampiric creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century
southeastern Europe
,
[19]
when
verbal traditions
of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are
revenants
of evil beings,
suicide
victims, or
witches
, but they can also be created by a
malevolent spirit
possessing
a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even
public executions
of people believed to be vampires.
[20]
Description and common attributes
Vampire
(1895) by
Edvard Munch
It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood, which was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin, and its left eye was often open.
[21]
It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature.
[22]
Chewing sounds were reported emanating from graves.
[23]
Creating vampires
Illustration of a vampire from
Max Ernst
's
Une Semaine de Bonté
(1934)
The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In
Slavic
and
Chinese traditions
, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead.
[24]
A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In
Russian folklore
, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the
Russian Orthodox Church
while they were alive.
[25]
In
Albanian folklore
, the
dhampir
is the hybrid child of the
karkanxholl
(a
lycanthropic
creature with an iron
mail
shirt) or the
lugat
(a water-dwelling
ghost
or monster). The dhampir sprung of a
karkanxholl
has the unique ability to discern the
karkanxholl
; from this derives the expression
the dhampir knows the lugat
. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep.
Dhampiraj
is also an Albanian surname.
[26]
Prevention
Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as
scythes
or
sickles
,
[27]
near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the
ancient Greek
practice of placing an
obolus in the corpse's mouth
to pay the toll to cross the
River Styx
in the underworld. The coin may have also been intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the
vrykolakas
, in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription "
Jesus Christ
conquers" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.
[28]
Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the
tendons at the knees
or placing
poppy
seeds,
millet
, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains,
[29]
[30]
indicating an association of vampires with
arithmomania
. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampiric being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in
myths from the Indian subcontinent
, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.
[31]
Identifying vampires
Many rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.
[25]
Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white.
[32]
Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.
[33]
Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition.
[34]
In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face.
[35]
Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor
poltergeist
-styled activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects,
[36]
and
pressing
on people in their sleep.
[37]
Protection
Garlic, Bibles, crucifixes, rosaries, holy water, and mirrors have all been seen in various folkloric traditions as
means of warding against
or identifying vampires.
[38]
[39]
Apotropaics
—items able to ward off revenants—are common in vampire folklore.
Garlic
is a common example;
[40]
a branch of
wild rose
and
hawthorn
are sometimes associated with causing harm to vampires, and in Europe,
mustard seeds
would be sprinkled on the roof of a house to keep them away.
[41]
Other apotropaics include sacred items, such as
crucifix
,
rosary
, or
holy water
. Some folklore also states that vampires are unable to walk on
consecrated ground
, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.
[39]
Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic,
mirrors
have been used to ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a
soul
).
[42]
This attribute is not universal (the Greek
vrykolakas/tympanios
was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in
Dracula
and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.
[43]
Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please.
[42]
Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to
sunlight
.
[43]
Reports in 1693 and 1694 concerning citings of vampires in Poland and Russia claimed that when a vampire's grave was recognized, eating bread baked with its blood mixed into the flour,
[44]
or simply drinking it, granted the possibility of protection. Other stories (primarily the
Arnold Paole
case) claimed the eating of dirt from the vampire's grave would have the same effect.
[45]
Methods of destruction
A runestone with an inscription to keep the deceased in its grave.
[46]
Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with
staking
the most commonly cited method, particularly in South Slavic cultures.
[47]
Ash
was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states,
[48]
or
hawthorn
in Serbia,
[49]
with a record of
oak
in
Silesia
.
[50]
[51]
Aspen
was also used for stakes, as it was believed that
Christ's cross
was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night).
[52]
Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany
[53]
[54]
and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.
[55]
Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of "deflating" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of "
anti-vampire burial
": burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.
[56]
Decapitation
was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the
buttocks
or away from the body.
[47]
This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.
[57]
800-year-old skeleton found in Bulgaria stabbed through the chest with an iron rod.
[58]
Romani people
drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near
Venice
, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006.
[59]
In
Bulgaria
, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as
plough
bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.
[58]
Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In Southeastern Europe, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling
holy water
on the body, or by
exorcism
. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the
coffin
was taken. For resistant cases, the body was
dismembered
and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In
Saxon regions
of Germany, a
lemon
was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.
[60]
Ancient beliefs
Lilith
, 1887 by
John Collier
. Stories of Lilith depict her as a demon drinking blood.
Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries.
[61]
The term
vampire
did not exist in ancient times.
Blood drinking
and similar activities were attributed to
demons
or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the
devil
was considered synonymous with the vampire.
[62]
Almost every culture associates blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India tales of
vetālas
, ghoulish beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the
Baitāl Pacīsī
; a prominent story in the
Kathāsaritsāgara
tells of King
Vikramāditya
and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one.
[63]
Piśāca
, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.
[64]
The
Persians
were one of the first civilizations to have tales of blood-drinking demons: creatures attempting to drink blood from men were depicted on excavated
pottery
shards.
[65]
Ancient
Babylonia
and
Assyria
had tales of the mythical
Lilitu
,
[66]
synonymous with and giving rise to
Lilith
(
Hebrew
לילית) and her daughters the
Lilu
from
Hebrew demonology
. Lilitu was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies,
[66]
and
estries
, female shapeshifting, blood-drinking demons, were said to roam the night among the population, seeking victims. According to
Sefer Hasidim
, estries were creatures created in the twilight hours before
God rested
. An injured estrie could be healed by eating bread and salt given to her by her attacker.
[67]
Greco-Roman mythology
described the
Empusae
,
[68]
the
Lamia
,
[69]
the
Mormo
[70]
and the
striges
. Over time the first two terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa was the daughter of the goddess
Hecate
and was described as a demonic,
bronze
-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood.
[68]
The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the
gelloudes
or
Gello
.
[69]
Like the Lamia, the
striges
feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as
strix
, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.
[71]
Medieval and later European folklore
Main article:
Vampire folklore by region
Lithograph showing townsfolk burning the exhumed skeleton of an alleged vampire.
Many myths surrounding vampires originated during the
medieval period
. The 12th-century British historians and chroniclers
Walter Map
and
William of Newburgh
recorded accounts of revenants,
[20]
[72]
though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant.
[73]
The
Old Norse
draugr
is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires.
[74]
Vampiric beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi
David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra
(Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event to the lack of a
shmirah
(guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.
[75]
In 1645, the Greek librarian of the Vatican,
Leo Allatius
, produced the first methodological description of the Balkan beliefs in vampires (Greek: vrykolakas) in his work
De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus
("On certain modern opinions among the Greeks").
[76]
Vampires properly originating in folklore were widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularized.
[77]
An early recording of the time came from the region of
Istria
in modern
Croatia
, in 1672; Local reports described a panic among the villagers inspired by the belief that
Jure Grando
had become a vampire after dying in 1656, drinking blood from victims and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart. Later, his corpse was also beheaded.
[78]
Title page of
treatise on the chewing and smacking of the dead in graves
(1734), a book on vampirology by
Michael Ranft
.
From 1679, Philippe Rohr devotes an essay to the dead who chew their shrouds in their graves, a subject resumed by Otto in 1732, and then by
Michael Ranft
in 1734. The subject was based on the observation that when digging up graves, it was discovered that some corpses had at some point either devoured the interior fabric of their coffin or their own limbs.
[79]
Ranft described in his treatise of a tradition in some parts of Germany, that to prevent the dead from masticating they placed a mound of dirt under their chin in the coffin, placed a piece of money and a stone in the mouth, or tied a handkerchief tightly around the throat.
[80]
In 1732 an anonymous writer writing as "the doctor Weimar" discusses the non-putrefaction of these creatures, from a theological point of view.
[81]
In 1733, Johann Christoph Harenberg wrote a general treatise on vampirism and the
Marquis d'Argens
cites local cases. Theologians and clergymen also address the topic.
[79]
Some theological disputes arose. The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic Church. A paragraph on vampires was included in the second edition (1749) of
De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione
, On the
beatification
of the servants of God and on
canonization
of the blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini (
Pope Benedict XIV
).
[82]
In his opinion, while the
incorruption
of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of "imagination, terror and fear". In other words, vampires did not exist.
[83]
18th-century vampire controversy
During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires.
[77]
Despite being called the
Age of Enlightenment
, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe.
[20]
The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in
East Prussia
in 1721 and in the
Habsburg monarchy
from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two infamous vampire cases, the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of
Petar Blagojevich
and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.
[77]
In the second case, Miloš, an ex-soldier-turned-farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while
haying
. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Miloš had returned to prey on the neighbours.
[84]
[85]
Another infamous Serbian vampire legend recounts the story of a certain
Sava Savanović
, who lives in a watermill and kills and drinks blood from the millers. The character was later used in the story
After Ninety Years
(1880) written by Serbian writer
Milovan Glišić
and in the Yugoslav 1973 horror film
Leptirica
inspired by the story.
[86]

Dom Augustine Calmet
from 1750
The two incidents were well-documented. Government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe.
[85]
The hysteria, commonly referred to as the "18th-Century Vampire Controversy", continued for a generation. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-called vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them.
[87]
Dom Augustine Calmet
, a French theologian and scholar, published a comprehensive treatise in 1751 titled
Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants
which investigated and analysed the evidence for vampirism.
[87]
[b]
Numerous readers, including both a critical
Voltaire
and numerous supportive
demonologists
interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.
[87]
[c]
The controversy in Austria ceased when Empress
Maria Theresa
sent her personal physician,
Gerard van Swieten
, to investigate the claims of vampiric entities. He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, ending the vampire epidemics. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local folklore.
[87]
Non-European beliefs
Beings having many of the attributes of European vampires appear in the folklore of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.
[90]
Africa
Various regions of Africa have folktales featuring beings with vampiric abilities: in
West Africa
the
Ashanti people
tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling
asanbosam
,
[91]
and the
Ewe people
of the
adze
,
which can take the form of a
firefly
and hunts children.
[92]
The eastern
Cape
region has the
impundulu
,
which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the
Betsileo
people of
Madagascar
tell of the
ramanga
, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles.
[93]
In colonial East Africa, rumors circulated to the effect that employees of the state such as firemen and nurses were vampires, known in Swahili as
wazimamoto
.
[94]
Americas
The
Loogaroo
is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or
voodoo
. The term
Loogaroo
possibly comes from the French
loup-garou
(meaning "werewolf") and is common in the
culture of Mauritius
. The stories of the
Loogaroo
are widespread through the
Caribbean Islands
and
Louisiana
in the United States.
[95]
Similar female monsters are the
Soucouyant
of
Trinidad
, and the
Tunda
and
Patasola
of
Colombian folklore
, while the
Mapuche
of southern
Chile
have the bloodsucking snake known as the
Peuchen
.
[96]
Aloe vera
hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American folklore.
[31]
Aztec mythology
described tales of the
Cihuateteo
, skull-faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.
[25]
During the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was
widespread in parts of New England
, particularly in
Rhode Island
and eastern
Connecticut
. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term "vampire" was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease
tuberculosis
, or "consumption" as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves.
[97]
The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old
Mercy Brown
, who died in
Exeter, Rhode Island
in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.
[98]
Asia
Vampires have appeared in
Japanese cinema
since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin.
[99]
The
Nukekubi
is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night.
[100]
Legends of female vampiric beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the
Philippines
,
Malaysia
, and
Indonesia
. There are two main vampiric creatures in the Philippines: the
Tagalog
Mandurugo
("blood-sucker") and the
Visayan
Manananggal
("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the
aswang
that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, threadlike tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.
[101]
The
manananggal
is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge batlike wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck
fetuses
from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the
heart
and the
liver
) and the phlegm of sick people.
[101]
The Malaysian
Penanggalan
is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of
black magic
or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women.
[102]
Malaysians hung
jeruju
(thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the
Penanggalan
would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns.
[103]
The
Leyak
is a similar being from
Balinese folklore
of Indonesia.
[104]
A
Kuntilanak
or
Matianak
in Indonesia,
[105]
or
Pontianak
or
Langsuir
in Malaysia,
[106]
is a woman who
died during childbirth
and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming
langsuir.
This description would also fit the
Sundel Bolongs
.
[107]
A stilt house typical of the
Tai Dam
ethnic minority of Vietnam, whose communities were said to be terrorized by the blood-sucking
ma cà rồng
.
In
Vietnam
, the word used to translate Western vampires, "ma cà rồng", originally referred to a type of demon that haunts modern-day
Phú Thọ Province
, within the communities of the
Tai Dam
ethnic minority
. The word was first mentioned in the chronicles of 18th-century
Confucian
scholar
Lê Quý Đôn
,
[108]
who spoke of a creature that lives among humans, but stuffs its toes into its
nostrils
at night and flies by its ears into houses with pregnant women to suck their blood. Having fed on these women, the
ma cà rồng
then returns to its house and cleans itself by dipping its toes into barrels of
sappanwood
water. This allows the
ma cà rồng
to live undetected among humans during the day, before heading out to attack again by night.
[109]
Jiangshi
, sometimes called "Chinese vampires" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence (
qì
) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person's soul (魄
pò
) fails to leave the deceased's body.
[110]
Jiangshi
are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought.
[111]
This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or
mould
growing on corpses.
[112]
Jiangshi legends have inspired a
genre of jiangshi films
and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like
Encounters of the Spooky Kind
and
Mr. Vampire
were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.
[113]
[114]
Modern beliefs
In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic
villain
.
[22]
Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons.
[20]
Allegations of vampire attacks swept through
Malawi
during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor
Eric Chiwaya
, based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires.
[115]
Fears and violence recurred in late 2017, with 6 people accused of being vampires killed.
[116]
A vampire costume
In early 1970, local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted
Highgate Cemetery
in London. Amateur
vampire hunters
flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the "
Highgate Vampire
" and who later claimed to have
exorcised
and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area.
[117]
In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in
Birmingham
, England, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets. Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an
urban legend
.
[118]
The
chupacabra
("goat-sucker") of
Puerto Rico
and
Mexico
is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of
domesticated animals
, leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The "chupacabra hysteria" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s.
[119]
In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.
[120]
Origins of vampire beliefs
Commentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs and related
mass hysteria
. Everything ranging from
premature burial
to the early ignorance of the body's
decomposition
cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.
[121]
Pathology
Decomposition
Author Paul Barber stated that belief in vampires resulted from people of
pre-industrial societies
attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition.
[121]
People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.
[122]
Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look "plump", "well-fed", and "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the
Arnold Paole case
, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life.
[123]
The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.
[35]
Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition.
[124]
The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of
flatulence
when they passed through the anus. The official reporting on the
Petar Blagojevich
case speaks of "other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect".
[125]
After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Blagojevich case—the
dermis
and
nail beds
emerging underneath were interpreted as "new skin" and "new nails".
[125]
Premature burial
Vampire legends may have also been influenced by individuals being
buried alive
because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and it would appear that they had been "feeding".
[126]
A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies.
[127]
Another likely cause of disordered tombs is
grave robbery
.
[128]
Disease
Folkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community.
[97]
The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of
Mercy Brown
and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of
bubonic plague
, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.
[129]
In 1985, biochemist
David Dolphin
proposed a link between the rare blood disorder
porphyria
and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous
haem
, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.
[130]
The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood.
[131]
Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely.
[132]
Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention
[133]
and entered popular modern folklore.
[134]
Juan Gómez-Alonso, a neurologist, examined the possible link of rabies with vampire folklore. The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. It can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and
hypersexuality
. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection).
Wolves
and
bats
, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.
[135]
[136]
Psychodynamic theories
In his 1931 treatise
On the Nightmare
, Welsh
psychoanalyst
Ernest Jones
asserted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and
defence mechanisms
. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may
project
the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.
[137]
In cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to
repression
, which
Sigmund Freud
had linked with the development of morbid dread.
[138]
Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect may or may not be present.
[139]
Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their
fear of dying
.
[140]
Jones linked the innate sexuality of bloodsucking with
cannibalism
, with a folkloric connection with
incubus
-like behaviour. He added that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular
sadism
; he felt that
oral sadism
is integral in vampiric behaviour.
[141]
Political interpretations
Political cartoon
from 1885, depicting the
Irish National League
as the "Irish Vampire" preying on a sleeping woman.
The reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones.
[142]
The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic
ancien régime
. In his entry for "Vampires" in the
Dictionnaire philosophique
(1764), Voltaire notices how the mid-18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now "there were stock-jobbers, brokers, and men of business, who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight; but they were not dead, though corrupted. These true suckers lived not in cemeteries, but in very agreeable palaces".
[143]
Marx defined capital as "dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks".
[d]
Werner Herzog
, in his
Nosferatu the Vampyre
, gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist
Jonathan Harker
, a middle-class solicitor, becomes the next vampire; in this way the capitalist
bourgeois
becomes the next parasitic class.
[144]
Psychopathology
A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims.
Serial killers
Peter Kürten
and
Richard Trenton Chase
were both called "vampires" in the
tabloids
after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. In 1932, an unsolved murder case in
Stockholm
, Sweden, was nicknamed the "
Vampire murder
", because of the circumstances of the victim's death.
[145]
The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer
Elizabeth Báthory
became infamous in later centuries' works, which depicted her bathing in her victims' blood to retain beauty or youth.
[146]
Vampire bats
Main article:
Vampire bat
A
vampire bat
in Peru.
Although many cultures have stories about them,
vampire bats
have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore. Vampire bats were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century.
[147]
There are no vampire bats in Europe, but
bats
and
owls
have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits.
[147]
[148]
The three species of vampire bats are all
endemic
to Latin America, and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any
Old World
relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the
Oxford English Dictionary
records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The danger of
rabies
infection aside, the vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.
[147]
The literary
Dracula
transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of
Dracula
followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the
film
, where
Béla Lugosi
would transform into a bat.
[147]
The bat transformation scene was used again by
Lon Chaney Jr.
in 1943's
Son of Dracula
.
[149]
In modern culture

List of vampires
The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was
John Polidori
's "
The Vampyre
" (1819), featuring the vampire
Lord Ruthven
.
[150]
Lord Ruthven's exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the
antihero
. The vampire theme continued in
penny dreadful
serial publications such as
Varney the Vampire
(1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history:
Dracula
by
Bram Stoker
, published in 1897.
[151]
Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth,
[152]
and
Count Orlok
of
Murnau's
Nosferatu
(1922) fearing daylight.
[153]
The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright
Hamilton Deane
to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.
[154]
Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.
[155]
Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore,
immortality
is one attribute which features heavily in vampire films and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for the blood of former equals.

Literature

Vampire literature
Cover from one of the original serialized editions of
Varney the Vampire
The vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as
The Vampire
(1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder,
Lenore
(1773) by
Gottfried August Bürger
,
Die Braut von Corinth
(
The Bride of Corinth
) (1797) by
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
,
Robert Southey
's
Thalaba the Destroyer
(1801),
John Stagg
's "The Vampyre" (1810),
Percy Bysshe Shelley
's
"The Spectral Horseman"
(1810) ("Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore") and "Ballad" in
St. Irvyne
(1811) about a reanimated corpse, Sister Rosa,
Samuel Taylor Coleridge
's unfinished
Christabel
and
Lord Byron
's
The Giaour
.
[157]
Byron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires: "The Vampyre" (1819). This was in reality authored by Byron's personal physician,
John Polidori
, who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient, "
Fragment of a Novel
" (1819), also known as "The Burial: A Fragment".
[20]
[151]
Byron's own dominating personality, mediated by his lover
Lady Caroline Lamb
in her unflattering
roman-a-clef
Glenarvon
(a Gothic fantasia based on Byron's wild life), was used as a model for Polidori's undead protagonist
Lord Ruthven
.
The Vampyre
was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.
[158]
Varney the Vampire
was a popular mid-
Victorian era
gothic horror
story by
James Malcolm Rymer
and
Thomas Peckett Prest
, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as
penny dreadfuls
because of their low price and gruesome contents.
[150]
Published in book form in 1847, the story runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney.
[155]
Another important addition to the genre was
Sheridan Le Fanu
's
lesbian vampire
story
Carmilla
(1871). Like Varney before her, the vampiress Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.
[159]
Carmilla
by
Sheridan Le Fanu
, illustrated by
D. H. Friston
, 1872.
No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as Bram Stoker's
Dracula
(1897).
[160]
Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in
Victorian
Europe where
tuberculosis
and
syphilis
were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.
[150]
Drawing on past works such as
The Vampyre
and
Carmilla
, Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as
The Land Beyond the Forest
(1888) by
Emily Gerard
and other books about
Transylvania
and vampires. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of
Vlad Ţepeş
, the "real-life Dracula", and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as "
Dracula's Guest
".
[161]
The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics as well as a renewed interest in the subject in books. The first of these was Gothic romance writer
Marilyn Ross
's
Barnabas Collins
series (1966-71), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series
Dark Shadows
. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic
tragic heroes
rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular
Vampire Chronicles
(1976-2003),
[162]
and
Stephenie Meyer
's
Twilight
series (2005-2008).

A scene from
F. W. Murnau
's
Nosferatu
, 1922.
Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film, television, and gaming industries.
Dracula is a major character
in more films than any other but
Sherlock Holmes
, and many early films were either based on the novel
Dracula
or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 silent German Expressionist horror film
Nosferatu
, directed by
F. W. Murnau
and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic
Dracula
'
s.
[164]
Universal's
Dracula
(1931), starring
Béla Lugosi
as the Count and directed by
Tod Browning
, was the first
talking film
to portray Dracula. Both Lugosi's performance and the film overall were influential in the blossoming
horror film
genre, now able to use sound and special effects much more efficiently than in the
Silent Film Era
.  The influence of this 1931 film lasted throughout the rest of the 20th century and up through the present day.
Stephen King
,
Francis Ford Coppola
,
Hammer Horror
, and
Philip Saville
each have at one time or another derived inspiration from this film directly either through staging or even through directly quoting the film, particularly how Stoker's line "
Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!
" is delivered by Lugosi; for example Coppola paid homage to this moment with Gary Oldman in his interpretation of the tale in 1992 and King has credited this film as an inspiration for his character Kurt Barlow repeatedly in interviews.
[165]
It is for these reasons that the film was selected by the US
Library of Congress
to be in the
National Film Registry
in 2000.
[166]
Count Dracula
as portrayed by
Béla Lugosi
in 1931's
Dracula
.
The legend of the vampire continued through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent
Hammer Horror
series of films, starring
Christopher Lee
as the Count. The successful 1958
Dracula
starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role.
[167]
By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as
Count Yorga, Vampire
(1970), an African Count in 1972's
Blacula
, the BBC's
Count Dracula
featuring French actor
Louis Jourdan
as Dracula and
Frank Finlay
as
Abraham Van Helsing
, and a Nosferatu-like vampire in 1979's
Salem's Lot
, and a remake of
Nosferatu
itself, titled
Nosferatu the Vampyre
with
Klaus Kinski
the same year. Several films featured the characterization of a female, often lesbian, vampire such as Hammer Horror's
The Vampire Lovers
(1970), based on
Carmilla
, though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character.
[167]
1960s television's
Dark Shadows
, with
Jonathan Frid
's
Barnabas Collins
vampire character.
The
Gothic
soap opera
Dark Shadows
, on American television from 1966 to 1971, featured the vampire character
Barnabas Collins
, portrayed by
Jonathan Frid
, which proved partly responsible for making the series one of the most popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later 1972 television series
Kolchak: The Night Stalker
revolved around a reporter hunting a vampire on the
Las Vegas Strip
. Later films showed more diversity in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as
Blade
in the
Marvel Comics
'
Blade
films and the film
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
.
[150]
Buffy
, released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with its adaptation to a
series of the same name
and its spin-off
Angel
. Others showed the vampire as a protagonist, such as 1983's
The Hunger
, 1994's
Interview with the Vampire
and its indirect sequel
Queen of the Damned
, and the 2007 series
Moonlight
. The 1992 film
Bram Stoker's Dracula
by
Francis Ford Coppola
became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.
[168]
This increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as
Underworld
and
Van Helsing
, the Russian
Night Watch
and a TV miniseries remake of
Salem's Lot
, both from 2004. The series
Blood Ties
premiered on
Lifetime Television
in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, an illegitimate-son-of-
Henry-VIII-of-England
-turned-vampire, in modern-day
Toronto
, with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled
True Blood
, gives a
Southern Gothic
take on the vampire theme.
[163]
In 2008
Being Human
premiered in Britain and featured a vampire that shared a flat with a werewolf and a ghost.
[169]
[170]
The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of
sexuality
and the perennial dread of mortality.
[171]
Games
Main article:
Vampires in games
The
role-playing game
Vampire: The Masquerade
has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as
embrace
and

Popular
video games about vampires
include
Castlevania
, which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel
Dracula
, and
Legacy of Kain

horror films
, the fiction of
Anne Rice
, and the styles of Victorian England.

The
combat of Mesas de Ibor
[note 2]
(17 March 1809) was a French victory during the
Peninsular War
at which the Spanish troops under General
Duke del Parque
were defeated by
Leval
's division, made up of German battalions.
[1]
Location
[
edit
]
The battle took place in the ravine of the Ibor river, a tributary of the
Tagus
, near
Mesas de Ibor
,
province of Cáceres
(
Extremadura
).
Background
[
edit
]
Much against his own wishes, General
Victor
, based at Salamanca, was forced to obey Napoleon's direct orders to advance on Extremadura.
[1]
He therefore set off, on 14 March, at the head of a corps that numbered 15,000 infantry, and about 5,500 cavalry, together with sixty guns (with 1,600 artillerymen). His army was made up of
Ruffin
's division (nine battalions),
Villatte
's division (twelve battalions),
Leval
's division of eight battalions (plus the Westphalian Cavalry regiment of the 4th Corps that had been attached to his division). His other cavalry consisted of his own two regiments, together with
Latour-Maubourg
's six regiments of dragoons and three regiments of
Lasalle
's light cavalry.
[1]
The battle
[
edit
]
Despite commanding a strong position, with six guns and 5,000 troops, on the heights of the other side of the ravine, Parque was forced to retreat, pushing his guns over the precipice, as
Leval
's eight German battalions, the vanguard of Victor's army, crossed the river and made their way up the sides of the ravine.
[1]
Outcome
[
edit
]
Parque retreated to  Cuesta's headquarters at
Deleitosa
.

Rochester Community Sports Complex Stadium
, also called the "downtown soccer stadium", is a
soccer-specific stadium
in
Rochester, New York
within the Rochester Community Sports Complex. It is home to the
Flower City Union
of the
National Independent Soccer Association
. Previously to the Flower City Union, the stadium was home in 2018 to the
Rochester Lancers
and
Lady Lancers
of the
NPSL
and
UWS
, respectively. The stadium originally hosted the
Rochester Rhinos
of the
USL
, the
Rochester Rattlers
of
MLL
, and the
Western New York Flash
of the
NWSL
.
The stadium hosts other sporting events such as
collegiate soccer
, Rochester Rhinos Elite youth soccer games and practices,
American football
,
field hockey
and
drum and bugle corps
competitions as well as concerts, as well as occasionally hosting the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA) Section V football championship and Far West Regional championship (played between Sections V and VI).  It is owned by the City of Rochester and is operated as a youth sports complex.
History
[
edit
]
The stadium was designed by
HOK Sport
(now Populous).  It was constructed on a filled-in section of the
Erie Canal
's original routing through
Rochester
. This was also once the route of the
Rochester Subway
, which was built in the old canal bed and ended operations in 1956. The facility was funded jointly by the state of
New York
, the city of Rochester, and the Rhinos (the State of New York paying $23 million while the Rhinos and the city paid the remaining amount). Infrastructure improvements will be paid for by the city of Rochester.
The park hit some minor stumbling blocks even before the first shovel hit dirt: the original designs needed to be revised when it was revealed that the playing field was below the
water table
, and the environmental impact report revealed that the site had pockets of petroleum that needed to be treated. The groundbreaking took place on July 9, 2004, and the first phase of the construction was completed.
[2]
The stadium had its grand opening (as
PAETEC Park
) on June 3, 2006, which featured the Rhinos' first home game of the season. The game was played in front of a capacity crowd of 13,768 fans and ended in a 2-2 draw against the
Virginia Beach Mariners
.
On August 22, 2018, it was announced that the Rhinos, then on a 1-year hiatus from the United Soccer League, would be leaving Marina Auto Stadium to pursue building a new stadium in the suburbs of Rochester.
[3]
In 2021, the city of Rochester added new facilities on the property that includes the stadium, by adding an indoor training facility to the Rochester Community Sports Complex.
[4]
Naming rights
[
edit
]
Naming rights
to the park were purchased by
PAETEC Communications
, a local telecommunications company, in 2004 for a reported total of $23 million over 12 years. When the club changed ownership, the agreement was voided at the end of the 2008 season.
[5]
The stadium then became known as
Rochester Rhinos Stadium
. In mid-2009, the team had a raffle to determine the naming rights for the stadium. For each $1,000 an individual, group, company, or other entity paid to the Rhinos, they were given one chance to win the right to name the stadium. On May 30, 2009, the night of the Rhinos' 2009 home opener, Marina Auto Group, a
Webster
-based automobile dealership group, won the raffle.
[6]
The Marina Auto name was retained through 2010 under a traditional naming rights agreement.
On February 10, 2011, it was announced that the new name of the stadium would be
Sahlen's Stadium
after the deal with Marina Auto expired. This was part of a five-year naming rights agreement with
Sahlen's
Packing Company, Inc. of
Buffalo, New York
, with an option to renew the agreement for another five years.
[7]
The cost of the agreement was not released, but was estimated at about $2 million.
[8]
In October 2015, the stadium operators announced that they would not exercise the option to continue the existing naming agreement with Sahlen's, but would instead seek a new agreement.
[9]
In the interim, the stadium reverted to being known as Rochester Rhinos Stadium.
[10]
On January 24, 2017,
Capelli Sport
entered a corporate partnership with the Rhinos and the stadium was renamed
Capelli Sport Stadium
.
[11]
Marina Auto Group entered into a new naming rights deal in 2018, reverting the name of the stadium back to
Marina Auto Stadium
.
[12]
Without a regular tenant from 2019 the facility became known as "the downtown soccer stadium" as part of the City of Rochester's Community Sports Complex.
[13]
[14]
Events
[
edit
]
The
Rochester Rhinos
and
Rochester Rhinos Women
soccer
teams of the
USL First Division
and
USL W-League
, respectively, and the
Rochester Rattlers
of
Major League Lacrosse
moved to the facility in 2006. The Rattlers were dissolved following the
2008 MLL season
but returned for the
2011 MLL season
. The Rochester Rhinos Women dissolved and were replaced by the
Rochester Ravens

Offensive odor or taste of pork from non-castrated adult male pigs
Boar taint
is the offensive odor or taste that can be evident during the cooking or eating of
pork
or pork products derived from non-castrated male pigs once they reach puberty. Boar taint is found in around 20% of entire male finishing pigs.
Skatole
may also be detected in
gilts
, but this is linked with fecal contamination of the skin. Studies show that about 75% of consumers are sensitive to boar taint, leading pork producers to control this in order to maximize profits.
[1]
Causes
[
edit
]
Boar taint is caused by the accumulation of two compounds -
androstenone
and skatole - in the fat of male pigs.  Androstenone (a male pheromone) is produced in the testes as male pigs reach puberty and gives the meat a urine or sweat flavour, while skatole (a byproduct of intestinal bacteria, or bacterial metabolite of the amino acid
tryptophan
) is produced in both male and female pigs and gives the meat a 'fecal' flavour. However, levels are much higher in intact boars, because testicular steroids inhibit its breakdown by the liver. As a result, skatole accumulates in the fat of male pigs as they mature.

For centuries, pigs have been
castrated
to prevent boar taint. Castration rates vary from country to country, and most still do not use
anesthesia
or
analgesia
when castrating pigs. Commercial farms that do castrate will do so in the pig's first week of life.
Another possible method to control boar taint is to use
sex sorted semen
for artificial insemination so as to produce mostly female offspring. This method has been successfully used in cattle breeding, but the technique is still under research and no economical or practical solution yet exists in pig production.
As castration has received criticism in recent years, for welfare reasons, some producers and producer associations are seeking alternative methods to control boar taint.
[2]
Some producers are breeding out the taint and avoiding the few breeds of pigs that are high in taint. Yorkshire, Hampshire and other lighter-colored pigs are known to be particularly low in the androstenone-based taint while Duroc pigs are high in the taint.

Vaccination
[

]
Vaccination
against boar taint with
Improvac
,
[3]
: 503
which has been used in Australia and New Zealand since 1998, is a solution
[2]
[4]
[3]
: 503
[5]
that uses the pig's immune system to control boar taint. The use of the vaccine is claimed to be as simple and reliable as physical castration in controlling boar taint. It can be administered by trained farm personnel and enables the production of pork meat that is claimed to be of high quality and to be safe for consumers to eat.
[6]
The vaccine works by stimulating the pig's immune system to produce specific antibodies against
gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH). This temporarily inhibits testes function and thus stops the production and accumulation of boar taint-causing compounds.
By stimulating production of antibodies specific to GnRH, the vaccine stops the chain of events that lead to the release of testosterone and other steroids from the testes, including androstenone, one of the two causes of boar taint. The other major taint-causing compound, skatole, is also eliminated, because the lower steroid levels allow the liver to more efficiently metabolise it.
Each pig must be immunised twice to successfully control boar taint. The timing of the first dose is relatively flexible, but there must be a minimum of four weeks between the two doses, with the second taking place four to six weeks before slaughter. After the second dose, the boar's testicles stop growing. The handler should be trained in the use of the vaccine and the vaccinator with enhanced safety features.
The vaccine is claimed to offer an animal-friendly and a more environmentally sustainable solution to boar taint, and to allow getting benefits of natural boar growth while preserving eating quality.
[7]
[8]
[9]
[10]
[11]
[12]
However concerns about the effect of the drugs on animal and consumer health have been expressed.
[13]
The vaccine will work in multiple mammalian species and is commonly used for contraceptive purposes in zoo animals and
oestrus
suppression in horses. The vaccine would also work to temporarily prevent sexual function in humans, but no cases of this have ever been recorded.

) is an
Abrahamic
monotheistic
religion
based on the
life
and
teachings
of
Jesus
of Nazareth. It is the
world's largest
and most widespread religion with roughly 2.4 billion followers representing one-third of the
global population
.
[1]
[2]
Its adherents, known as
Christians
, are estimated to make up a majority of the population in
157 countries and territories
.
[3]
Christians believe that
Jesus
is the
Son of God
, whose coming as the
Messiah
was
prophesied
in the
Hebrew Bible
(called the
Old Testament
in Christianity) and chronicled in the
New Testament
.
[4]
Christianity remains
culturally diverse
in its
Western
and
Eastern branches
, and doctrinally diverse concerning
justification and the nature of salvation
,
ecclesiology
,
ordination
, and
Christology
. The
creeds
of various
Christian denominations
generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the
Logos
incarnated
—who
ministered
,
suffered
, and
died on a cross
, but
rose from the dead
for the
salvation
of humankind; and referred to as
the gospel
, meaning the "good news". The four
canonical gospels
of
Matthew
,
Mark
,
Luke
and
John
describe Jesus's life and teachings, with the Old Testament as the gospels' respected background.
Christianity began
in the 1st century
after the birth of Jesus
as a
Judaic
sect with
Hellenistic influence
, in the
Roman
province of
Judea
. The
disciples
of Jesus
spread their faith
around the
Eastern Mediterranean
area, despite
significant persecution
. The inclusion of
Gentiles
led Christianity to slowly
separate from Judaism
(2nd century).
Emperor
Constantine the Great
decriminalized Christianity in the
Roman Empire
by the
Edict of Milan
(313), later convening the
Council of Nicaea
(325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the
State church of the Roman Empire
(380). The
Church of the East
and
Oriental Orthodoxy
both split over differences in
Christology
(5th century),
[5]
while the
Eastern Orthodox Church
and the
Catholic Church
separated in the
East-West Schism
(1054).
Protestantism
split into numerous denominations from the Catholic Church in the
Reformation
era (16th century). Following the
Age of Discovery
(15th-17th century), Christianity expanded throughout the world via
missionary work
, extensive trade
[6]
and
colonialism
. Christianity played
a prominent role
in the
development
of
Western civilization
, particularly in Europe from
late antiquity
and the
Middle Ages
.
[7]

[10]
The six major
branches of Christianity
are
Roman Catholicism
(1.3 billion people),
Protestantism
(800 million),
[note 1]
Eastern Orthodoxy
(220 million),
Oriental Orthodoxy
(60 million),
[12]
[13]
Restorationism
(35 million),
[14]
and the
Church of the East
(600 thousand). Smaller church communities number in the thousands despite efforts toward unity (
ecumenism
).
[15]
In the
West
, Christianity remains the dominant religion even with a
decline in adherence
, with about 70% of that population identifying as Christian.
[16]
[17]
Christianity is growing
in
Africa
and
Asia
, the world's most populous continents.
[16]
Christians remain greatly
persecuted
in many regions of the world, particularly in the
Middle East
,
North Africa
,
East Asia
, and

Etymology
Early Jewish Christians referred to themselves as 'The Way' (
Koinē Greek
:
τῆς ὁδοῦ
,
romanized:
tês hodoû
), probably coming from
Isaiah 40:3
, "prepare the way of the Lord".
[note 2]
According to
Acts 11:26
, the term "Christian" (
Χρῑστῐᾱνός
,
Khrīstiānós
), meaning "followers of Christ" in reference to Jesus's
disciples
, was first used in the city of
Antioch
by the non-Jewish inhabitants there.
[25]
The earliest recorded use of the term "Christianity/Christianism" (
Χρῑστῐᾱνισμός
,
Khrīstiānismós
) was by
Ignatius of Antioch
around 100
AD
.
[26]
Beliefs
While Christians worldwide share basic convictions, there are differences of interpretations and opinions of the
Bible
and
sacred traditions
on which Christianity is based.

Nicene Creed
Concise doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as
creeds
. They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the
Christological
controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith. "
Jesus is Lord
" is the earliest creed of Christianity and continues to be used, as with the
World Council of Churches
.
[28]
The
Apostles' Creed
is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of Christian faith. It is used by a number of
Christian denominations
for both
liturgical
and
catechetical
purposes, most visibly by liturgical churches of
Western Christian
tradition, including the
Latin Church
of the
Catholic Church
,
Lutheranism
,
Anglicanism
, and
Western Rite Orthodoxy
. It is also used by
Presbyterians
,
Methodists
, and
Congregationalists
.
This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the
Trinity
and
God
the
Creator
. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the
apostolic period
. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.
[29]
Its points include:
Belief in
God the Father
,
Jesus Christ
as the
Son of God
, and the
Holy Spirit
The
death
,
descent into hell
,
resurrection
and
ascension
of Christ
The holiness of the
Church
and the
communion of saints
Christ's
second coming
, the
Day of Judgement
and
salvation
of the faithful
The
Nicene Creed
was formulated, largely in response to
Arianism
, at the Councils of
Nicaea
and
Constantinople
in 325 and 381 respectively,
[30]
[31]
and ratified as the universal creed of
Christendom
by the
First Council of Ephesus
in 431.
[32]
The
Chalcedonian Definition
, or Creed of Chalcedon, developed at the
Council of Chalcedon
in 451,
[33]
though rejected by the
Oriental Orthodox
,
[34]
taught Christ "to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably": one divine and one human, and that both natures, while perfect in themselves, are nevertheless also
perfectly united into one person
.
[35]
The
Athanasian Creed
, received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: "We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the
Substance
".
[36]
Most Christians (
Catholic
,
Eastern Orthodox
,
Oriental Orthodox
, and
Protestant
alike) accept the use of creeds and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.
[37]
Certain
Evangelical Protestants
, though not all of them, reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds. Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the
Restoration Movement
, such as the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
, the
Evangelical Christian Church in Canada
, and the
Churches of Christ
.

Jesus in Christianity
and

See also:
Incarnation (Christianity)
and
Jesus in comparative mythology
The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in
Jesus
as the
Son of God
and the
Messiah
(Christ).
[41]
Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was
anointed
by God as savior of humanity and hold that Jesus's coming was the fulfillment of
messianic prophecies
of the
Old Testament
. The Christian concept of messiah differs significantly from
the contemporary Jewish concept
. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of
the death and resurrection of Jesus
,
sinful
humans can be reconciled to God, and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of
eternal life
.
[42]
While there have been many
theological
disputes over the
nature of Jesus
over the earliest centuries of Christian history, generally, Christians believe that Jesus is
God incarnate
and "
true God and true man
" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become
fully human
, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not
sin
. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the
New Testament
, he
rose
from the dead,
[43]
ascended
to heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father,
[44]
and will ultimately
return
[45]
to fulfill the rest of the
Messianic prophecy
, including the
resurrection of the dead
, the
Last Judgment
, and the final establishment of the
Kingdom of God
.
According to the
canonical gospels
of
Matthew
and
Luke
, Jesus was
conceived
by the
Holy Spirit
and
born
from
the Virgin Mary
. Little of Jesus's childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels, although
infancy gospels
were popular in antiquity.
[46]
In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the gospels contained within the
New Testament
, because that part of his life is believed to be most important. The biblical accounts of
Jesus's ministry
include:
his baptism
,
miracles
, preaching, teaching, and deeds.
Death and resurrection

Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see
1 Corinthians 15
) and the most important event in history.
[47]
Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based.
[48]
According to the New Testament, Jesus was
crucified
, died a physical death, was buried within a tomb, and rose from the dead three days later.
[49]
The
New Testament mentions
several
post-resurrection appearances of Jesus
on different occasions to his
twelve apostles
and
disciples
, including "more than five hundred brethren at once",
[50]
before Jesus's
ascension
to heaven. Jesus's death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during
Holy Week
, which includes
Good Friday
and
Easter
Sunday.
The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in
Christian theology
, partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people
eternal life
.
[51]
Christian churches accept and teach the
New Testament
account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.
[52]
Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus's followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the
historical Jesus
and the proclamation of the
early church
.
[53]
Some
liberal Christians
do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,
[54]
[55]
seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing
myth
. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious
debates
and
interfaith dialogues
.
[56]
Paul the Apostle
, an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless".
[57]
[58]
Salvation
Main article:
Salvation in Christianity
"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life".
— John 3:16, NIV
[59]
The Law and the Gospel
by Lucas Cranach the Elder (1529); Moses and Elijah point the sinner to Jesus for salvation.
Paul the Apostle
, like Jews and Roman
pagans
of his time, believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties, purity, and eternal life.
[60]
For Paul, the necessary sacrifice was the death of Jesus: Gentiles who are "Christ's" are, like Israel, descendants of Abraham and "heirs according to the promise"
[61]
[62]
The God who raised Jesus from the dead would also give new life to the "mortal bodies" of Gentile Christians, who had become with Israel, the "children of God", and were therefore no longer "in the flesh".
[63]
[60]
Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be
saved
from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to
Eastern Orthodox
theology, based upon their understanding of the atonement as put forward by Irenaeus'
recapitulation theory
, Jesus' death is a
ransom
. This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of
theosis
c.q.
divinization
, becoming the kind of humans God wants humanity to be. According to Catholic doctrine, Jesus' death
satisfies
the wrath of God, aroused by the offense to God's honor caused by human's sinfulness. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.
[64]
In Protestant theology, Jesus' death is regarded as a
substitutionary penalty
carried by Jesus, for the debt that has to be paid by humankind when it broke God's moral law.
[65]
Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are
completely incapable of self-redemption
, but that
sanctifying grace is irresistible
.
[66]
In contrast
Catholics
, Orthodox Christians, and
Arminian
Protestants believe that the exercise of
free will
is necessary to have faith in Jesus.
[67]
Trinity
Main article:
Trinity
The
Trinity
is the belief that
God
is one God in three persons: the
Father
, the
Son
(
Jesus
), and the
Holy Spirit
.
[68]
Trinity
refers to the teaching that the one God
[69]
comprises three distinct, eternally co-existing persons: the
Father
, the
Son
(incarnate in Jesus Christ) and the
Holy Spirit
. Together, these three persons are sometimes called the
Godhead
,
[70]
[71]
[72]
although there is no single term in use in Scripture to denote the unified Godhead.
[73]
In the words of the
Athanasian Creed
, an early statement of Christian belief, "the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God".
[74]
They are distinct from another: the Father has no source, the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Though distinct, the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation. While some Christians also believe that God appeared as the Father in the
Old Testament
, it is agreed that he appeared as the Son in the
New Testament
and will still continue to manifest as the Holy Spirit in the present. But still, God still existed as three persons in each of these times.
[75]
However, traditionally there is a belief that it was the Son who appeared in the Old Testament because, for example, when the
Trinity is depicted in art
, the Son typically has the distinctive appearance, a
cruciform halo
identifying Christ, and in depictions of the
Garden of Eden
, this looks forward to an Incarnation yet to occur. In some
Early Christian
sarcophagi
, the Logos is distinguished with a beard, "which allows him to appear ancient, even pre-existent".
[76]
The
Trinity
is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed (325) Christianity advocated
[77]
the triune
mystery
-nature of
God
as a normative profession of faith. According to
Roger E. Olson
and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded "that God must exist as both a unity and trinity", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.
[78]
[79]
According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see
Perichoresis
). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in
Western Christian
theology)
from the Son
. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three "persons" are each
eternal
and
omnipotent
. Other Christian religions including
Unitarian Universalism
,
Jehovah's Witnesses
, and
Mormonism
, do not share those views on the Trinity.
The Greek word
trias
[80]
[note 3]
is first seen in this sense in the works of
Theophilus of Antioch
; his text reads: "of the Trinity, of God, and of His Word, and of His Wisdom".
[84]
The term may have been in use before this time; its Latin equivalent,
[note 3]
trinitas
,
[82]
appears afterwards with an explicit reference to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in
Tertullian
.
[85]
[86]
In the following century, the word was in general use. It is found in many passages of
Origen
.
[87]
Trinitarianism
Main article:
Trinitarianism
Trinitarianism
denotes Christians who believe in the concept of the
Trinity
. Almost all Christian denominations and churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words "Trinity" and "Triune" do not appear in the Bible, beginning in the 3rd century theologians developed the term and concept to facilitate
apprehension
of the New Testament teachings of God as being Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply that there are three gods (the antitrinitarian heresy of
Tritheism
), nor that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God (partialism), nor that the Son and the Holy Spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the Father (
Arianism
). Rather, the Trinity is defined as one God in three persons.
[88]
Nontrinitarianism
Main article:
Nontrinitarianism
Nontrinitarianism
(or
antitrinitarianism
) refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as
adoptionism
or
modalism
, existed in early Christianity, leading to disputes about

Eschatology
Main article:
Christian eschatology
The end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking, is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the
Tribulation
, death and the afterlife, (mainly for
Evangelical
groups)
the Millennium
and the following
Rapture
, the
Second Coming
of Jesus,
Resurrection of the Dead
, Heaven, (for
liturgical
branches)
Purgatory
, and Hell, the
Last Judgment
, the end of the world, and the
New Heavens and New Earth
.
Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the
end of time
, after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be
resurrected bodily from the dead
for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the
Kingdom of God
in fulfillment of
scriptural prophecies
.
[91]
[92]
Death and afterlife
Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or
eternal damnation
. This includes the
general judgement
at the
resurrection of the dead
as well as the belief (held by Catholics,
[93]
[94]
Orthodox
[95]
[96]
and most Protestants) in a
judgment particular to the individual soul
upon physical death.
In the Catholic branch of Christianity, those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of
purgatory
to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence.
[97]
Those who have attained this goal are called
saints
(Latin
sanctus
, "holy").
[98]
Some Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold to
mortalism
, the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to
Annihilationism
, the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.

Depending on the specific
denomination of Christianity
, practices may include
baptism
, the
Eucharist
(Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper),
prayer
(including the
Lord's Prayer
),
confession
,
confirmation
,
burial rites
,
marriage
rites and the religious education of children. Most denominations have
ordained
clergy
who lead regular
communal
worship services.
[101]
Christian rites
, rituals, and ceremonies are not celebrated in one single sacred language. Many ritualistic Christian churches make a distinction between sacred language, liturgical language and vernacular language. The three important languages in the
early Christian era
were:
Latin
,
Greek
and
Syriac
.
[102]
[103]
[104]
Communal worship
Services
of worship typically follow a pattern or form known as
liturgy
.
[note 4]
Justin Martyr
described 2nd-century Christian liturgy in his
First Apology
(
c.
150
) to Emperor
Antoninus Pius
, and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:
And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the
president
verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying
Amen
; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.
[106]
Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship typically on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospels.
[note 5]
[107]
Instruction is given based on these readings, in the form of a
sermon
or
homily
. There are a variety of
congregational
prayers, including thanksgiving, confession, and
intercession
, which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung.
[101]
Psalms
,
hymns
,
worship songs
, and other
church music
may be sung.
[108]
[109]
Services can be varied for special events like significant
feast days
.
[110]
Nearly all forms of worship incorporate the Eucharist, which consists of a meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples
bread
, saying, "This is my body", and gave them
wine
saying, "This is my blood".
[111]
In the
early church
, Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the service.
[112]
Some denominations such as
Confessional Lutheran
churches continue to practice '
closed communion
'.
[113]
They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics further restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of
mortal sin
.
[114]
Many other churches, such as
Anglican Communion
and the
Methodist Churches
(such as the
Free Methodist Church
and
United Methodist Church
), practice '
open communion
' since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.

2nd-century description of the
Eucharist
And this food is called among us
Eukharistia
[the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.
Justin Martyr
[106]
In Christian belief and practice, a
sacrament
is a
rite
, instituted by Christ, that confers
grace
, constituting a
sacred mystery
. The term is derived from the
Latin
word
sacramentum
, which was used to translate the Greek word for
mystery
. Views concerning both which rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament, vary among Christian denominations and traditions.
[118]
The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are
Baptism
and the Eucharist; however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments:
Confirmation
(
Chrismation
in the Eastern tradition),
Holy Orders
(or
ordination
),
Penance
(or
Confession
),
Anointing of the Sick
, and
Matrimony
(see
Christian views on marriage
).
[118]
Taken together, these are the
Seven Sacraments
as recognized by churches in the
High Church
tradition—notably
Catholic
,
Eastern Orthodox
,
Oriental Orthodox
,
Independent Catholic
,
Old Catholic
, many
Anglicans
, and some
Lutherans
. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.
[118]
Certain denominations of Christianity, such as Anabaptists, use the term "
ordinances
" to refer to rites instituted by Jesus for Christians to observe.
[119]
Seven ordinances have been taught in many
Conservative Mennonite
Anabaptist churches, which include "baptism, communion, footwashing, marriage, anointing with oil, the holy kiss, and the prayer covering".
[100]
In addition to this, the
Church of the East
has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of Matrimony and the Anointing of the Sick. These include
Holy Leaven
(Melka) and the
sign of the cross
.

Liturgical calendar
Main article:
Liturgical year
See also:
Calendar of saints
Catholics, Eastern Christians, Lutherans, Anglicans and other traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the
liturgical year
.
[121]
The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of
seasons
, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colors of
paraments
and
vestments
for clergy,
[122]
scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.
Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the
Roman Rite
of the Catholic Church,
[122]
and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective
rites
. Calendars set aside holy days, such as
solemnities
which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus, Mary, or the
saints
, and periods of
fasting
, such as
Lent
and other pious events such as
memoria
, or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as
Christmas
,
Easter
, and
Pentecost
: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations such as
Quaker Christians
make no use of a liturgical calendar.

Symbols

Christian symbolism

Most Christian denominations have not generally practiced
aniconism
,
[124]
the avoidance or prohibition of devotional images, even if early
Jewish Christians
, invoking the
Decalogue's
prohibition of
idolatry
, avoided figures in their symbols.
[125]
The
cross
, today one of the most widely recognized symbols, was used by Christians from the earliest times.
[126]
[127]
Tertullian, in his book
De Corona
, tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace the sign of the cross on their foreheads.
[128]
Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the
crucifix
did not appear in use until the 5th century.
[129]
Among the earliest Christian symbols, that of the fish or
Ichthys
seems to have ranked first in importance, as seen on monumental sources such as tombs from the first decades of the 2nd century.
[130]
Its popularity seemingly arose from the Greek word
ichthys
(fish) forming an
acrostic
for the Greek phrase
Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter
(Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ),
[note 6]
(Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior), a concise summary of Christian faith.
[130]
Other major Christian symbols include the
chi-rho monogram
, the
dove and olive branch
(symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (representing Christ's sacrifice), the
vine
(symbolizing the connection of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from passages of the New Testament.

Baptism is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the
Church
. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance. Some, such as the Catholic and
Eastern Orthodox churches
, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the doctrine of
baptismal regeneration
, which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation.
Baptists
and
Plymouth Brethren
view baptism as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person, but not as spiritually efficacious. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology (or mode) of the act. These modes are: by
immersion
; if immersion is total, by
submersion
; by
affusion
(pouring); and by
aspersion
(sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of
infant baptism
;
[131]
[132]
[133]
[134]
the Orthodox Churches all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[135]
[136]
The Lutheran Church and the Catholic Church also practice infant baptism,
[137]
[138]
[139]
usually by affusion, and using the
Trinitarian formula
.
[140]
Anabaptist Christians
practice
believer's baptism
, in which an adult chooses to receive the ordinance after making a decision to follow Jesus.
[141]
Anabaptist denominations such as the
Mennonites
,
Amish
and
Hutterites
use
pouring
as the mode to administer believer's baptism, whereas Anabaptists of the
Schwarzenau Brethren
and
River Brethren
traditions baptize by
immersion
.

"... ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil’".
— The
Lord's Prayer
, Matthew 6:9-13,
EHV
[146]
In the
Gospel of Saint Matthew
, Jesus taught the
Lord's Prayer
, which has been seen as a model for Christian prayer.
[147]
The injunction for Christians to pray the Lord's prayer thrice daily was given in the
Didache
and came to be recited by Christians at 9 am, 12 pm, and 3 pm.
[148]
[149]
In the second century
Apostolic Tradition
,
Hippolytus
instructed Christians to pray at
seven fixed prayer times
: "on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight" and "the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion".
[150]
Prayer positions, including kneeling, standing, and
prostrations
have been used for these seven fixed prayer times since the days of the early Church.
[151]
Breviaries
such as the
Shehimo
and
Agpeya
are used by
Oriental Orthodox Christians
to pray these
canonical hours
while facing in the
eastward direction of prayer
.
[152]
[153]
The
Apostolic Tradition
directed that the
sign of the cross
be used by Christians during the
minor exorcism
of
baptism
, during
ablutions
before praying at fixed prayer times, and in times of temptation.
[154]
Intercessory prayer
is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the
Apostle Peter
on behalf of sick persons
[155]
and by
prophets
of the Old Testament in favor of other people.
[156]
In the
Epistle of James
, no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet
Elijah
.
[157]
The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.
[158]
The ancient church, in both
Eastern
and
Western Christianity
, developed a tradition of asking for the
intercession of (deceased) saints
, and this remains the practice of most
Eastern Orthodox
,
Oriental Orthodox
,
Catholic
, and some
Lutheran
and
Anglican
churches.
[159]
Apart from certain sectors within the latter two denominations, other Churches of the Protestant Reformation, however, rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.
[160]
The reformer
Huldrych Zwingli
admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was
idolatrous
.
[161]
According to the
Catechism of the Catholic Church
: "Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God".
[162]
The
Book of Common Prayer
in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.
[163]
Frequently in Western Christianity, when praying, the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal
commendation ceremony
. At other times the older
orans
posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

Development of the Christian biblical canon
, and
Religious text
The
Bible
is the sacred book in Christianity.
Christianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the
biblical canon
, the
Old Testament
and the
New Testament
, as the
inspired
word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in
is
theopneustos
, which literally means "God-breathed".
[164]
Some believe that divine inspiration makes present Bibles
inerrant
. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the
King James Version
.
[165]
[166]
[167]
Another closely related view is
biblical infallibility
or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography, or science.
The canon of the Old Testament accepted by Protestant churches, which is only the
Tanakh
(the canon of the
Hebrew Bible
), is shorter than that accepted by the Orthodox and Catholic churches which also include the
deuterocanonical books
which appear in the
Septuagint
, the Orthodox canon being slightly larger than the Catholic;
[168]
Protestants regard the latter as
apocryphal
, important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar, and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[169]
The New Testament, originally written in
Koine Greek
, contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all major churches.
Some denominations have
additional canonical holy scriptures
beyond the Bible, including the
standard works
of the
Latter Day Saints movement
and
Divine Principle
in the
Unification Church
.

Catholic interpretation
Main article:
Catholic theology of Scripture
St. Peter's Basilica
,
Vatican City
, the largest church in the world and a symbol of the
Catholic Church
In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in
Alexandria
and
Antioch
. The Alexandrian interpretation, exemplified by
Origen
, tended to read Scripture
allegorically
, while the Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called
theoria
) could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.
[171]
Catholic theology
distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.
[172]
The
literal
sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The
spiritual
sense is further subdivided into:
The
allegorical
sense, which includes
typology
. An example would be the
parting of the Red Sea
being understood as a "type" (sign) of baptism.
[173]
The
moral
sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
The
anagogical
sense, which applies to
eschatology
, eternity and the
consummation of the world
.
Regarding
exegesis
, following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:
The injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the
literal
[174]
[175]
That the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held
[176]
That scripture must be read within the "living Tradition of the whole Church"
[177]
and
That "the task of interpretation has been entrusted to the bishops in communion with the successor of Peter, the
Bishop
of
Rome
".
[178]
Protestant interpretation
Qualities of Scripture
Many Protestant Christians, such as Lutherans and the Reformed, believe in the doctrine of
sola scriptura
—that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and
revealed all truth
necessary for salvation;
[179]
[180]
other Protestant Christians, such as Methodists and Anglicans, affirm the doctrine of
prima scriptura
which teaches that Scripture is the primary source for Christian doctrine, but that "tradition, experience, and reason" can nurture the Christian religion as long as they are in harmony with the Bible.
[179]
[181]
Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear in its meaning (or "perspicuous"). Martin Luther believed that without God's help, Scripture would be "enveloped in darkness".
[182]
He advocated for "one definite and simple understanding of Scripture".
[182]
John Calvin
wrote, "all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light".
[183]
Related to this is "efficacy", that Scripture is able to lead people to faith; and "sufficiency", that the Scriptures contain everything that one needs to know to obtain salvation and to live a Christian life.
[184]
Original intended meaning of Scripture
Protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the
historical-grammatical method
.
[185]
The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in
Biblical hermeneutics
to find the intended original meaning in the text.
[186]
This original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre, as well as theological (canonical) considerations.
[187]
The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text. The significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As
Milton S. Terry
said: "A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture".
[188]
Technically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Taken together, both define the term (Biblical) hermeneutics.
[186]
Some Protestant interpreters make use of
typology
.

Christianity developed during the 1st century AD as a
Jewish Christian
sect with
Hellenistic
influence
[190]
of
Second Temple Judaism
.
[191]
[192]
An early Jewish Christian community was founded in
Jerusalem
under the leadership of the
Pillars of the Church
, namely
James the Just
, the brother of Jesus,
Peter
, and John.
[193]
Jewish Christianity soon attracted Gentile God-fearers, posing a problem for its
Jewish religious outlook
, which insisted on close observance of the Jewish commandments.
Paul the Apostle
solved this by insisting that salvation by
faith in Christ
, and
participation
in his death and resurrection by their baptism, sufficed.
[194]
At first he persecuted the early Christians, but after a conversion experience he preached to the
gentiles
, and is regarded as having had a formative effect on the emerging
Christian
identity as separate from Judaism. Eventually, his departure from Jewish customs would result in the establishment of Christianity as an independent religion.

This formative period was followed by the early
bishops
, whom Christians consider the
successors of Christ's apostles
. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the
Church Fathers
, and the study of them is called
patristics
. Notable early Fathers include
Ignatius of Antioch
,
Polycarp
,
Justin Martyr
,
Irenaeus
,
Tertullian
,
Clement of Alexandria
and
Origen
.
Persecution of Christians
occurred intermittently and on a small scale by both Jewish and
Roman authorities
, with Roman action starting at the time of the
Great Fire of Rome
in 64 AD. Examples of early executions under Jewish authority reported in the
New Testament
include the deaths of
Saint Stephen
[196]
and
James, son of Zebedee
.
[197]
The
Decian persecution
was the first empire-wide conflict,
[198]
when the edict of
Decius
in 250 AD required everyone in the Roman Empire (except Jews) to perform a sacrifice to the Roman gods. The
Diocletianic Persecution
beginning in 303 AD was also particularly severe. Roman persecution ended in 313 AD with the
Edict of Milan
.
While
Proto-orthodox Christianity
was becoming dominant, heterodox sects also existed at the same time, which held radically different beliefs.
Gnostic Christianity
developed a
duotheistic
doctrine based on illusion and enlightenment rather than forgiveness of sin. With only a few scriptures overlapping with the developing orthodox canon, most
Gnostic texts
and
Gnostic gospels
were eventually considered heretical and suppressed by mainstream Christians. A gradual splitting off of
Gentile Christianity
left
Jewish Christians
continuing to follow the
Law of Moses
, including practices such as circumcision. By the fifth century, they and the
Jewish-Christian gospels
would be largely suppressed by the dominant sects in both Judaism and Christianity.

King Tiridates III
made Christianity the
state religion
in
Armenia
between 301 and 314,
[204]
[205]
[206]
thus Armenia became the first officially Christian state. It was not an entirely new religion in Armenia, having penetrated into the country from at least the third century, but it may have been present even earlier.
[207]
Constantine I
was exposed to Christianity in his youth, and throughout his life his support for the religion grew, culminating in baptism on his deathbed.
[208]
During his reign, state-sanctioned persecution of Christians was ended with the
Edict of Toleration
in 311 and the
Edict of Milan
in 313. At that point, Christianity was still a minority belief, comprising perhaps only 5% of the Roman population.
[209]
Influenced by his adviser
Mardonius
, Constantine's nephew
Julian
unsuccessfully tried to suppress Christianity.
[210]
On 27 February 380,
Theodosius I
,
Gratian
, and
Valentinian II
established
Nicene Christianity
as the
State church of the Roman Empire
.
[211]
As soon as it became connected to the state, Christianity grew wealthy; the Church solicited donations from the rich and could now own land.
[212]
Constantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the
First Council of Nicaea
in 325, which sought to address
Arianism
and formulated the Nicene Creed, which is still used by in
Catholicism
,
Eastern Orthodoxy
,
Lutheranism
,
Anglicanism
, and many other
Protestant
churches.
[213]
[37]
Nicaea was the first of a series of
ecumenical councils
, which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning
Christology
.
[214]
The
Church of the East
did not accept the third and following ecumenical councils and is still separate today by its successors (
Assyrian Church of the East
).
In terms of prosperity and cultural life, the
Byzantine Empire
was one of the peaks in
Christian history
and
Christian civilization
,
[215]
and
Constantinople
remained the leading city of the
Christian world
in size, wealth, and culture.
[216]
There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy
, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.
[217]
Byzantine art and literature held a preeminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of
Byzantine art
on the West during this period was enormous and of long-lasting significance.
[218]
The later rise of
Islam
in North Africa reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations, leaving in large numbers only the
Coptic Church
in Egypt, the
Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church
in the Horn of Africa and the
Nubian Church
in the Sudan (Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia).
Middle Ages
Main article:
Christianity in the Middle Ages
Early Middle Ages
Christendom
by AD 600 after its
spread to Africa and Europe
from the Middle East
With the decline and
fall of the Roman Empire in the West
, the
papacy
became a political player, first visible in
Pope Leo
's diplomatic dealings with
Huns
and
Vandals
.
[219]
The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. While
Arianists
instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see the
Massacre of Verden
, for example), what would later become
Catholicism
also spread among the
Hungarians
, the
Germanic
,
[219]
the
Celtic
, the
Baltic
and some
Slavic peoples
.
Around 500, Christianity was thoroughly integrated into Byzantine and
Kingdom of Italy
culture
[220]
and
Benedict of Nursia
set out
his Monastic Rule
, establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of
monasteries
.
[219]
Monasticism
became a powerful force throughout Europe,
[219]
and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in
Ireland
,
Scotland
, and
Gaul
, contributing to the
Carolingian Renaissance
of the 9th century.
In the 7th century,
Muslims conquered Syria
(including
Jerusalem
), North Africa, and Spain, converting some of the Christian population to
Islam
, and placing the rest under a separate
legal status
. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the Byzantine Empire in its decades long conflict with
Persia
.
[221]
Beginning in the 8th century, with the rise of
Carolingian
leaders, the Papacy sought greater political support in the
Frankish Kingdom
.
[222]
The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church.
Pope Gregory the Great
dramatically reformed the
ecclesiastical structure
and administration.
[223]
In the early 8th century,
iconoclasm
became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the
Byzantine
emperors. The
Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea
(787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.
[224]
In the early 10th century, Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of
Cluny
.
[225]

In the West, from the 11th century onward, some older cathedral schools
became universities
(see, for example,
University of Oxford
,
University of Paris
and
University of Bologna
). Previously, higher education had been the domain of Christian
cathedral schools
or
monastic schools
(
Scholae monasticae
), led by
monks
and
nuns
. Evidence of such schools dates back to the 6th century AD.
[226]
These new universities expanded the curriculum to include academic programs for clerics, lawyers, civil servants, and physicians.
[227]
The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the
Medieval Christian
setting.
[228]
[229]
[230]
Accompanying the rise of the "new towns" throughout Europe,
mendicant orders
were founded, bringing the
consecrated religious life
out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the
Franciscans
[231]
and the
Dominicans
,
[232]
founded by
Francis of Assisi
and
Dominic
, respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order was the
Cistercians
, whose large, isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period, church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of
Romanesque
and
Gothic architecture
and the building of the great European cathedrals.
[233]
Christian nationalism
emerged during this era in which Christians felt the impulse to recover lands in which Christianity had historically flourished.
[234]
From 1095 under the pontificate of
Urban II
, the
First Crusade
was launched.
[235]
These were a series of military campaigns in the
Holy Land
and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor
Alexios I
for aid against
Turkish
expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of
Constantinople
during the
Fourth Crusade
.
[236]
The Christian Church experienced internal conflict between the 7th and 13th centuries that resulted in a
schism
between the
Latin Church
of
Western Christianity
branch, the now-Catholic Church, and an
Eastern
, largely Greek, branch (the
Eastern Orthodox Church
). The two sides disagreed on a number of administrative, liturgical and doctrinal issues, most prominently
Eastern Orthodox opposition to papal supremacy
.
[237]
[238]
The
Second Council of Lyon
(1274) and the
Council of Florence
(1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases, the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions, and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Catholic Church has achieved union with various
smaller eastern churches
.
In the thirteenth century, a new emphasis on Jesus' suffering, exemplified by the Franciscans' preaching, had the consequence of turning worshippers' attention towards Jews, on whom
Christians had placed the blame for Jesus' death
. Christianity's limited tolerance of Jews was not new—Augustine of Hippo said that Jews should not be allowed to enjoy the citizenship that Christians took for granted—but the growing antipathy towards Jews was a factor that led to
the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290
, the first of many such expulsions in Europe.
[239]
[240]
Beginning around 1184, following the crusade against
Cathar
heresy,
[241]
various institutions, broadly referred to as the
Inquisition
, were established with the aim of suppressing
heresy
and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through
conversion
and prosecution.
[242]

and

See also:
European wars of religion
and
Renaissance Papacy
Martin Luther
initiated the
Reformation
with his
Ninety-five Theses
in 1517.
The 15th-century
Renaissance
brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. During the
Reformation
,
Martin Luther
posted the
Ninety-five Theses
1517 against the sale of
indulgences
.
[243]
Printed copies soon spread throughout Europe. In 1521 the
Edict of Worms
condemned and excommunicated Luther and his followers, resulting in the schism of the
Western Christendom
into several branches.
[244]
Other reformers like
Zwingli
,
Oecolampadius
,
Calvin
,
Knox
, and
Arminius
further criticized Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called
Protestantism
, which repudiated the
primacy of the pope
, the role of tradition, the
seven sacraments
, and other doctrines and practices.
[243]
The
Reformation in England
began in 1534, when
King Henry VIII
had himself
declared head
of the
Church of England
. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were
dissolved
.
[245]
Thomas Müntzer
,
Andreas Karlstadt
and other theologians perceived both the Catholic Church and the confessions of the
Magisterial Reformation
as corrupted. Their activity brought about the
Radical Reformation
, which gave birth to various
Anabaptist
denominations.

[246]
[247]
[248]
Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the
Counter-Reformation
or Catholic Reform.
[249]
The
Council of Trent
clarified and reasserted Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.
[250]
Meanwhile, the discovery of America by
Christopher Columbus
in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of
colonial expansion
by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Throughout Europe, the division caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of
religious violence
and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe.
Lutheranism
spread into the northern, central, and eastern parts of present-day Germany,
Livonia
, and Scandinavia.
Anglicanism
was established in England in 1534.
Calvinism
and its varieties, such as
Presbyterianism
, were introduced in Scotland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, and France.
Arminianism
gained followers in the Netherlands and
Frisia
. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of
conflicts
in which religion played a key factor. The
Thirty Years' War
, the
English Civil War
, and the
French Wars of Religion
are prominent examples. These events intensified the
Christian debate on persecution and toleration
.
[251]
In the revival of neoplatonism
Renaissance humanists
did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the greatest works of the
Renaissance
were devoted to it, and the Catholic Church patronized many works of
Renaissance art
.
[252]
Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church.
[252]
Some scholars and historians attribute Christianity to having contributed to the rise of the
Scientific Revolution
.
[253]
Many well-known historical figures who influenced
Western science
considered themselves Christian such as
Nicolaus Copernicus
,
[254]
Galileo Galilei
,
[255]
Johannes Kepler
,
[256]
Isaac Newton
[257]
and
Robert Boyle
.

Post-Enlightenment

In the era known as the
Great Divergence
, when in the West, the
Age of Enlightenment
and the
scientific revolution
brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of
skepticism
and with certain modern
political ideologies
, such as versions of
socialism
and
liberalism
.
[259]
Events ranged from mere
anti-clericalism
to violent outbursts against Christianity, such as the
dechristianization of France during the French Revolution
,
[260]
the
Spanish Civil War
, and certain
Marxist
movements, especially
the Russian Revolution
and the
persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union
under
state atheism
.
[261]
[262]
[263]
[264]
Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of
nation states
after the
Napoleonic era
. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition to greater or lesser extents with each other and with the state. Variables were the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political, and ideological orientation of the states. Urs Altermatt of the
University of Fribourg
, looking specifically at Catholicism in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic-majority countries such as Belgium, Spain, and Austria, to some extent, religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in Poland, the Republic of Ireland, and Switzerland, all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in Germany, the Netherlands, and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations, which to a greater or lesser extent identified with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and Italy, countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.
[265]
The combined factors of the formation of nation states and
ultramontanism
, especially in Germany and the Netherlands, but also in England to a much lesser extent,
[266]
often forced Catholic churches, organizations, and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the
First Vatican Council
, and in Germany would lead directly to the
Kulturkampf
.

[269]
while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. Changes in worldwide Christianity over the last century have been significant, since 1900, Christianity has spread rapidly in the
Global South
and Third World countries.
[270]
The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the
Third World
and the Southern Hemisphere in general,
[271]
[272]
with the West no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity. Approximately 7 to 10% of
Arabs
are
Christians

Syria
and

[277]
[278]
split into three main branches of Catholic, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox, Christianity is the
world's largest religion
.
[3]
High birth rates and
conversions
in the
global South
were cited as the reasons for the Christian population growth.
[279]
[280]
The Christian share of the world's population has stood at around 33% for the last hundred years, which means that one in three persons on Earth are Christians. This masks a major shift in the demographics of Christianity; large increases in the developing world have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world, mainly in Western Europe and North America.
[281]
According to a 2015
Pew Research Center
study, within the next four decades, Christianity will remain the largest religion; and by 2050, the Christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion.

According to some scholars, Christianity ranks at first place in net gains through
religious conversion
.
[284]
[285]
As a percentage of Christians, the
Catholic Church
and
Orthodoxy
(both
Eastern
and
Oriental
) are declining in some parts of the world (though Catholicism is growing in Asia, in Africa, vibrant in Eastern Europe, etc.), while
Protestants
and other Christians are on the rise in the developing world.
[286]
[287]
[288]
The so-called
popular Protestantism
[note 7]
is one of the fastest growing religious categories in the world.
[289]
[290]
[291]
Nevertheless, Catholicism will also continue to grow to 1.63 billion by 2050, according to Todd Johnson of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity.
[292]
Africa alone, by 2015, will be home to 230 million African Catholics.
[293]
And if in 2018, the U.N. projects that Africa's population will reach 4.5 billion by 2100 (not 2 billion as predicted in 2004), Catholicism will indeed grow, as will other religious groups.
[294]
According to Pew Research Center, Africa is expected to be home to 1.1 billion
African Christians
by 2050.
[282]
In 2010, 87% of the world's Christian population lived in countries where Christians are in the majority, while 13% of the world's Christian population lived in countries where Christians are in the minority.
[16]
Christianity is the predominant religion in Europe, the Americas, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
[16]
There are also large Christian communities in other parts of the world, such as
Central Asia
, the
Middle East and North Africa
,
East Asia
,
Southeast Asia
, and the
Indian subcontinent
.
[16]
In Asia, it is the dominant religion in Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, East Timor, and the Philippines.
[295]
However, it is declining in some areas including the northern and western United States,
[296]
some areas in Oceania (Australia
[297]
and New Zealand
[298]
), northern Europe (including Great Britain,
[299]
Scandinavia and other places), France, Germany, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec, and some parts of Asia (especially the Middle East, due to the
Christian emigration
,
[300]
[301]
[302]
and Macau
[303]
).
The Christian population is not decreasing in Brazil, the southern United States,
[304]
and the province of Alberta, Canada,
[305]
but the percentage is decreasing. Since the fall of communism, the proportion of Christians has been stable or even increased in the
Central
and
Eastern European
countries.
[306]
Christianity is growing rapidly in both numbers and percentage in China,

[309]
Despite a decline in adherence in the
West
, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the region, with about 70% of that population identifying as Christian.
[16]
Christianity remains the largest religion in
Western Europe
, where 71% of Western Europeans identified themselves as Christian in 2018.
[311]
A 2011
Pew Research Center
survey found that 76% of Europeans, 73% in Oceania and about 86% in the Americas (90% in Latin America and 77% in North America) identified themselves as Christians.
[3]
[16]
By 2010 about 157 countries and territories in the world had
Christian majorities
.
[3]
There are many
charismatic movements
that have become well established over large parts of the world, especially Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
[312]
[313]
[314]
[315]
[316]
Since 1900, primarily due to conversion, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and Latin America.
[317]
From 1960 to 2000, the global growth of the number of reported
Evangelical Protestants
grew three times the world's population rate, and twice that of
Islam
.
[318]
According to the historian
Geoffrey Blainey
from the
University of Melbourne
, since the 1960s there has been a substantial increase in the number of conversions from Islam to Christianity, mostly to the
Evangelical
and
Pentecostal
forms.
[319]
A study conducted by St. Mary's University estimated about 10.2 million
Muslim
converts to Christianity
in 2015;
[310]
[320]
according to the study significant numbers of Muslim converts to Christianity can be found in Afghanistan,
[310]
[321]
Azerbaijan,
[310]
[321]
Central Asia (including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and other countries),
[310]

and Tunisia
[325]
),
[310]
[321]
Sub-Saharan Africa,
[310]
[321]
and the Western World (including Albania, Belgium, France, Germany, Kosovo, the Netherlands, Russia, Scandinavia, United Kingdom, the United States, and other western countries).
[310]
[321]
It is also reported that Christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in Africa and Asia; according to a report by the
Singapore Management University
, more people in Southeast Asia are converting to Christianity, many of them young and having a
university degree
.
[308]
According to scholar Juliette Koning and Heidi Dahles of
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
there is a "rapid expansion" of
Christianity in Singapore
, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Indonesia
, Malaysia, and South Korea.
[308]
According to scholar Terence Chong from the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, since the 1980s Christianity is expanding in China, Singapore,
[326]
Indonesia,
Japan
,
[327]
[328]
Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea,
[16]
and Vietnam.
[329]
In most countries in the developed world,
church attendance
among people who continue to identify themselves as Christians has been falling over the last few decades.
[330]
Some sources view this as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions,
[331]
while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general.
[332]
Europe's Christian population, though in decline, still constitutes the largest geographical component of the religion.
[333]
According to data from the 2012 European Social Survey, around a third of
European Christians
say they attend services once a month or more.
[334]
Conversely, according to the
World Values Survey
, about more than two-thirds of Latin American Christians, and about 90% of
African Christians
(in Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa and Zimbabwe) said they attended church regularly.
[334]
According to a 2018 study by the
Pew Research Center
, Christians in Africa and Latin America and the United States have  high levels of commitment to their faith.
[335]

, in one form or another, is the sole
state religion

Christian denomination
.

Christianity can be taxonomically divided into six main groups:
Roman Catholicism
,
Protestantism
,
Oriental Orthodoxy
,
Eastern Orthodoxy
, the
Church of the East
, and
Restorationism
.
[14]
[350]
A broader distinction that is sometimes drawn is between
Eastern Christianity
and
Western Christianity
, which has its origins in the
East-West Schism
(Great Schism) of the 11th century. Recently, neither Western nor Eastern
World Christianity
has also stood out, for example, in
African-initiated churches
. However, there are other present
[351]
and historical
[352]
Christian groups that do not fit neatly into one of these primary categories.
There is a diversity of
doctrines
and
liturgical
practices among groups calling themselves Christian. These groups may vary
ecclesiologically
in their views on a classification of
Christian denominations
.
[353]
The Nicene Creed (325), however, is typically accepted as authoritative by most Christians, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and major Protestant, such as Lutheran and Anglican denominations.

Catholic Church
Main article:
Catholic Church
Pope Francis
, the current leader of the Catholic Church
The Catholic Church consists of those
particular Churches
, headed by bishops, in communion with the
pope
, the bishop of Rome, as its highest authority in matters of faith, morality, and church governance.
[355]
[356]
Like
Eastern Orthodoxy
, the Catholic Church, through
apostolic succession
, traces its origins to the Christian community founded by Jesus Christ.
[357]
[358]
Catholics maintain that the "
one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church
" founded by Jesus
subsists fully
in the Catholic Church, but also acknowledges other Christian churches and communities
[359]
[360]
and works towards
reconciliation
among all Christians.
[359]
The Catholic faith is detailed in the
Catechism of the Catholic Church
.
[361]
[362]
Of its
seven sacraments
, the
Eucharist
is the principal one, celebrated
liturgically
in the
Mass
.
[363]
The church teaches that through
consecration
by a
priest
, the sacrificial
bread
and
wine
become the body and blood of Christ
. The
Virgin Mary
is
venerated
in the Catholic Church as
Mother of God
and
Queen of Heaven
, honoured in
dogmas
and
devotions
.
[364]
Its teaching includes
Divine Mercy
,
sanctification
through faith and
evangelization
of
the Gospel
as well as
Catholic social teaching
, which emphasises voluntary support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the
corporal and spiritual works of mercy
. The Catholic Church operates thousands of
Catholic schools
,
universities
,
hospitals
, and orphanages around the world, and is the largest non-government provider of
education
and
health care
in the world.
[365]
Among its other social services are numerous charitable and humanitarian organizations.
Canon law
(
Latin
:
jus canonicum
)
[366]
is the
system
of
laws
and
legal principles
made and enforced by the
hierarchical authorities
of the Catholic Church to regulate its external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the church.
[367]
The canon law of the Latin Church was the first modern Western
legal system
,
[368]
and is the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West.
[369]
[370]
while the distinctive traditions of
Eastern Catholic canon law
govern the 23 Eastern Catholic
particular churches
sui iuris
.
As the world's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution,
[371]
it has played a prominent role in the history and development of
Western civilization
.
[372]
The 2,834
sees
[373]
are grouped into
24 particular autonomous Churches
(the largest of which being the
Latin Church
), each with its own distinct traditions regarding the
liturgy
and the administering of
sacraments
.
[374]
With more than 1.1 billion baptized members, the Catholic Church is the largest Christian
church
and represents 50.1%
[16]
of all Christians as well as 16.7% of the
world's population
.
[375]
[376]
[377]
Catholics live all over the world through
missions
,
diaspora
, and
conversions
.
Eastern Orthodox Church
Main article:
Eastern Orthodox Church
St. George's Cathedral
in
Istanbul
: It has been the seat of the
Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople
whose leader is regarded as the
primus inter pares
in the
Eastern Orthodox Church
.
[378]
The Eastern Orthodox Church consists of those churches in communion with the
patriarchal
sees of the East, such as the
Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople
.
[379]
Like the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through
apostolic succession
and has an
episcopal
structure, though the
autonomy
of its component parts is emphasized, and most of them are national churches.
Eastern Orthodox theology
is based on
holy tradition
which incorporates the dogmatic decrees of the
seven Ecumenical Councils
, the Scriptures, and the teaching of the
Church Fathers
. The church teaches that it is the
one, holy, catholic and apostolic
church
established by
Jesus Christ
in his
Great Commission
,
[380]
and that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles.
[381]
It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith, as passed down by holy tradition. Its
patriarchates
, reminiscent of the
pentarchy
, and other
autocephalous
and
autonomous
churches reflect a variety of
hierarchical
organisation
. It recognises seven major sacraments, of which the
Eucharist
is the principal one, celebrated
liturgically
in
synaxis
. The church teaches that through
consecration
invoked
by a
priest
, the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. The
Virgin Mary
is
venerated
in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the
God-bearer
, honoured in
devotions
.
Eastern Orthodoxy is the second largest single denomination in Christianity, with an estimated 230 million adherents, although
Protestants
collectively outnumber them, substantially.
[16]
[13]
[382]
As one of the oldest surviving religious institutions in the world, the
Eastern Orthodox Church
has played a prominent role in the history and culture of
Eastern
and
Southeastern Europe
, the
Caucasus
, and the
Near East
.
[383]
The majority of Eastern Orthodox Christians live mainly in
Southeast
and
Eastern Europe
,
Cyprus
,
Georgia
, and parts of the
Caucasus
region,
Siberia
, and the
Russian Far East
. Over half of Eastern Orthodox Christians follow the
Russian Orthodox Church
, while the vast majority live within
Russia
.
[384]
There are also communities in the former
Byzantine regions
of Africa, the
Eastern Mediterranean
, and in the
Middle East
. Eastern Orthodox communities are also present in many other parts of the world, particularly North America, Western Europe, and Australia, formed through
diaspora
,
conversions
, and
missionary
activity.
Oriental Orthodoxy
Main article:
Oriental Orthodoxy
Holy Trinity Cathedral
in
Addis Ababa
, the seat of the Ethiopian Orthodox; the largest of the Oriental Orthodox Churches
The
Oriental Orthodox Churches
(also called "Old Oriental" churches) are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils—
Nicaea
,
Constantinople
, and
Ephesus
—but reject the dogmatic definitions of the
Council of Chalcedon
and instead espouse a
Miaphysite christology
.
The Oriental Orthodox communion consists of six groups:
Syriac Orthodox
,
Coptic Orthodox
,
Ethiopian Orthodox
,
Eritrean Orthodox
,
Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church
(India), and
Armenian Apostolic
churches.
[385]
These six churches, while being in communion with each other, are completely independent hierarchically.
[386]
These churches are generally not in communion with the
Eastern Orthodox Church
, with whom they are in dialogue for erecting a communion.
[387]
Together, they have about 62 million members worldwide.
[388]
[389]
[390]
As some of the oldest religious institutions in the world, the Oriental Orthodox Churches have played a prominent role in the history and culture of
Armenia
,
Egypt
,
Turkey
,
Eritrea
,
Ethiopia
,
Sudan
and parts of the
Middle East
and
India
.
[391]
[392]
An Eastern Christian body of
autocephalous
churches
, its
bishops
are equal by virtue of
episcopal ordination
, and its doctrines can be summarized in that the churches recognize the validity of only the first three
ecumenical councils
.
[393]
Some Oriental Orthodox Churches such as the
Coptic Orthodox
,
Ethiopian Orthodox
,
Eritrean Orthodox
, places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in other Christian denominations, and its followers adhere to certain practices: following
dietary rules
that are similar to Jewish
Kashrut
,
[394]
require that their male members undergo
circumcision
,
[395]
and observes
ritual purification
.
[396]

Church of the East
Further information:
Assyrian Church of the East
and
Ancient Church of the East
A 6th-century
Nestorian church
, St. John the Arab, in the
Assyrian village
of
Geramon
in
Hakkari
, southeastern Turkey.
The
Church of the East
, which was part of the
Great Church
, shared
communion
with those in the
Roman Empire
until the
Council of Ephesus
condemned Nestorius
in 431. Continuing as a
dhimmi
community under the
Sunni Caliphate
after the
Muslim conquest of Persia
(633-654), the
Church of the East
played a major role in the history of
Christianity in Asia
. Between the 9th and 14th centuries, it represented the world's largest
Christian denomination
in terms of geographical extent. It established
dioceses
and communities stretching from the
Mediterranean Sea
and today's Iraq and
Iran
, to
India
(the
Saint Thomas Syrian Christians
of
Kerala
), the
Mongol kingdoms
in Central Asia, and
China
during the
Tang dynasty
(7th-9th centuries). In the 13th and 14th centuries, the church experienced a final period of expansion under the
Mongol Empire
, where influential Church of the East clergy sat in the Mongol court.
The
Assyrian Church of the East
, with an unbroken patriarchate established in the 17th century, is an independent
Eastern Christian
denomination which claims continuity from the
Church of the East
—in parallel to the Catholic patriarchate established in the 16th century that evolved into the
Chaldean Catholic Church
, an
Eastern Catholic
church in
full communion
with the
Pope
. It is an Eastern Christian
church
that follows the traditional
christology
and
ecclesiology
of the historical Church of the East. Largely
aniconic
and not in
communion
with any other church, it belongs to the eastern branch of
Syriac Christianity
, and uses the
East Syriac Rite
in its
liturgy
.
[398]
Saint Mary Church
; an ancient Assyrian church located in the city of
Urmia
, Iran
Its main spoken language is
Syriac
, a dialect of
Eastern Aramaic
, and the majority of its adherents are ethnic
Assyrians
, mostly living in
Iran
,
Iraq
,
Syria
,
Turkey
,
India
(
Chaldean Syrian Church
), and in the
Assyrian diaspora
.
[399]
It is officially headquartered in the city of
Erbil
in northern
Iraqi Kurdistan
, and its original area also spreads into south-eastern Turkey and north-western Iran, corresponding to ancient
Assyria
. Its hierarchy is composed of
metropolitan bishops
and
diocesan bishops
, while lower clergy consists of
priests
and
deacons
, who serve in dioceses (eparchies) and parishes throughout the Middle East, India, North America, Oceania, and Europe (including the
Caucasus
and Russia).
[400]
The
Ancient Church of the East
distinguished itself from the
Assyrian Church of the East
in 1964. It is one of the
Assyrian
churches that claim continuity with the historical Church of the East, one of the oldest Christian churches in Mesopotamia.
[401]
It is officially headquartered in the city of
Baghdad
, Iraq.
[402]
The majority of its adherents are ethnic
Assyrians
.
[402]
Protestantism
Main articles:
Protestantism
and
Proto-Protestantism
See also:
Protestant ecclesiology
In 1521, the
Edict of Worms
condemned
Martin Luther
and officially banned citizens of the
Holy Roman Empire
from defending or propagating his ideas.
[403]
This split within the Roman Catholic church is now called the
Reformation
. Prominent Reformers included Martin Luther,
Huldrych Zwingli
, and
John Calvin
. The 1529
Protestation at Speyer
against being excommunicated gave this party the name
Protestantism
. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as
Lutherans
. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally and are referred to as the
Reformed tradition
.
[404]
Protestants have developed
their own culture
, with major contributions in education, the
humanities and sciences
, the political and social order, the
economy
and the arts, and many other fields.
[405]
[406]
The
Anglican
churches descended from the
Church of England
and organized in the
Anglican Communion
. Some, but not all Anglicans consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.
[407]
[408]
Since the Anglican, Lutheran, and the Reformed branches of Protestantism originated for the most part in cooperation with the government, these movements are termed the  "
Magisterial Reformation
". On the other hand, groups such as the
Anabaptists
, who often do not consider themselves to be Protestant, originated in the
Radical Reformation
, which though sometimes protected under
Acts of Toleration
, do not trace their history back to any state church. They are further distinguished by their rejection of infant baptism; they believe in baptism only of adult believers—
credobaptism
(Anabaptists include the
Amish
,
Apostolic
,
Bruderhof
,
Mennonites
,
Hutterites
,
River Brethren
and
Schwarzenau Brethren
groups.)
[409]
[410]
[411]
[412]
The term
Protestant
also refers to any churches which formed later, with either the Magisterial or Radical traditions. In the 18th century, for example,
Methodism
grew out of
Anglican
minister
John Wesley
's
evangelical revival movement
.
[413]
Several
Pentecostal
and
non-denominational churches
, which emphasize the cleansing power of the
Holy Spirit
, in turn grew out of Methodism.
[414]
Because Methodists, Pentecostals and other evangelicals stress "accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior",
[415]
which comes from Wesley's emphasis of the
New Birth
,
[416]
they often refer to themselves as being
born-again
.
[417]
[418]
Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism by number of followers, although the Eastern Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination.
[376]
Estimates vary, mainly over the question of which denominations to classify as Protestant. Yet, the total number of Protestant Christians is  generally estimated between 800 million and 1 billion, corresponding to nearly 40% of the world's Christians.
[13]
[286]
[419]
[420]
The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families, i.e.
Adventists
,
Anglicans
,
Baptists
,
Reformed (Calvinists)
,
[421]
Lutherans,
Methodists
,
Moravians
/
Hussites
, and
Pentecostals
.
[286]
Nondenominational
,
evangelical
,
charismatic
,
neo-charismatic
, independent, and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestant Christianity.
[422]
Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves as "Christians" or "
born-again
Christians". They typically distance themselves from the
confessionalism
and
creedalism
of other Christian communities
[423]
by calling themselves "
non-denominational
" or "
evangelical
". Often founded by individual pastors, they have little affiliation with historic denominations.
[424]
Historical chart of the main Protestant branches
Restorationism
Main article:
Restorationism
A 19th-century drawing of
Joseph Smith
and
Oliver Cowdery
receiving the
Aaronic priesthood
from
John the Baptist
.
Latter Day Saints
believe that the
Priesthood
ceased to exist after the death of the apostles and therefore needed to be
restored
.
The
Second Great Awakening
, a period of religious revival that occurred in the United States during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as
restoring
the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches.
[425]
A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the
Great Apostasy
.
[426]
In Asia,
Iglesia ni Cristo
is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.
Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century camp meetings in the Midwest and upstate New York. One of the largest churches produced from the movement is
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
.
[427]
American
Millennialism
and
Adventism
, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the
Jehovah's Witnesses
movement and, as a reaction specifically to
William Miller
, the
Seventh-day Adventists
. Others, including the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
,
Evangelical Christian Church in Canada
,
[428]
[429]
Churches of Christ
, and the
Christian churches and churches of Christ
, have their roots in the contemporaneous Stone-Campbell
Restoration Movement
, which was centered in Kentucky and Tennessee. Other groups originating in this time period include the
Christadelphians
and the previously mentioned
Latter Day Saints movement
. While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.
[430]
Other
Unitarian Church of Transylvania

Cluj-Napoca
Within Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Transylvania, Hungary, Romania, and the United Kingdom,
Unitarian Churches
emerged from the
Reformed
tradition in the 16th century;
[431]
the
Unitarian Church of Transylvania
is an example of such a denomination that arose in this era.
[432]
They adopted the
Anabaptist
doctrine of
credobaptism
.
[433]
Various smaller
Independent Catholic
communities, such as the
Old Catholic Church
,
[434]
include the word
Catholic
in their title, and arguably have more or less liturgical practices in common with the Catholic Church but are no longer in
full communion
with the
Holy See
.
[435]
Spiritual Christians
, such as the
Doukhobors
and
Molokans
, broke from the
Russian Orthodox Church
and maintain close association with Mennonites and
Quakers
due to similar religious practices; all of these groups are furthermore collectively considered to be
peace churches
due to their belief in
pacifism
.
[436]
[437]
Messianic Judaism
(or the Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. The movement originated in the 1960s and 1970s, and it blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of "Yeshua" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs.
[438]
Esoteric Christians
, such as
The Christian Community
,
[439]
regard Christianity as a
mystery religion
[440]
[441]
and profess the existence and possession of certain
esoteric
doctrines or practices,
[442]
[443]
hidden from the public and accessible only to a narrow circle of "enlightened", "initiated", or highly educated people.
[444]
[445]
Nondenominational Christianity
or non-denominational Christianity consists of
churches
which typically distance themselves from the
confessionalism
or
creedalism
of other Christian communities
[423]
by not formally aligning with a specific
Christian denomination
.
[446]
Nondenominational Christianity first arose in the 18th century through the
Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement
, with followers organizing themselves as "
Christians
" and "
Disciples of Christ
",
[note 8]
[446]
[447]
but many typically adhere to
evangelical Christianity
.

[451]
[452]
[453]
Since the spread of Christianity from the
Levant
to
Europe
and
North Africa
during the early
Roman Empire
, Christendom has been divided in the pre-existing
Greek East and Latin West
. Consequently, different versions of the Christian cultures arose with their own rites and practices, centred around the cities of Rome (
Western Christianity
) and
Carthage
, whose communities were called Western or Latin Christendom,
[454]
and
Constantinople
(
Eastern Christianity
),
Antioch
(
Syriac Christianity
),
Kerala
(
Indian Christianity
) and
Alexandria
(
Coptic Christianity
), whose communities were called Eastern or Oriental Christendom.
[455]
[456]
[457]
The
Byzantine Empire
was one of the peaks in
Christian history
and Eastern
Christian civilization
.
[215]
From the 11th to 13th centuries,
Latin Christendom
rose to the central role of the
Western world
.
The Bible has had a profound influence on Western civilization and on cultures around the globe; it has contributed to the formation of
Western law
,
art
,
texts
, and education.
[458]
[459]
[460]
With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible is one of the most influential works ever written. From practices of
personal hygiene
to philosophy and ethics, the Bible has directly and indirectly influenced politics and law, war and peace, sexual morals, marriage and family life, toilet etiquette, letters and learning, the arts, economics, social justice, medical care and more.
[460]
Christians
have made a myriad of contributions to
human progress
in a broad and diverse range of fields, including philosophy,
[461]
science and technology
,
[462]
[463]
[464]
[465]
medicine
,
[466]
fine arts and architecture
,
[467]

[469]
[470]
According to
100 Years of Nobel Prizes
a review of the Nobel Prizes award between 1901 and 2000 reveals that (65.4%) of
Nobel Prizes
Laureates,
have identified Christianity
in its various forms as their religious preference.
[471]
Outside the Western world, Christianity has had an influence on various cultures, such as in Africa, the Near East, Middle East, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.
[472]
[473]
Eastern Christian scientists and scholars of the medieval Islamic world
(particularly
Jacobite
and
Nestorian
Christians) contributed to the Arab
Islamic civilization
during the reign of the
Ummayyads
and the
Abbasids
, by translating works of
Greek philosophers
to
Syriac
and afterwards, to
Arabic
.
[474]
[475]
[476]
They also excelled in philosophy, science, theology, and medicine.
[477]
[478]
[479]
Scholars and intellectuals agree
Christians in the Middle East
have made significant contributions to Arab and Islamic civilization since the introduction of
Islam
, and they have had a significant impact contributing the culture of the
Mashriq
,
Turkey
, and
Iran
.
[480]
[472]
Influence on Western culture
Western culture
, throughout most of its history, has been nearly equivalent to
Christian culture
, and a large portion of the population of the Western Hemisphere can be described as practicing or nominal Christians. The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "Christianity and Christendom". Many historians even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified
European identity
.
[481]
Though Western culture contained several polytheistic religions during its early years under the
Greek
and
Roman Empires
, as the centralized Roman power waned, the dominance of the Catholic Church was the only consistent force in Western Europe.
[482]
Until the
Age of Enlightenment
,
[482]
Christian culture guided the course of philosophy, literature, art, music and science.
[482]
[451]
Christian disciplines of the respective arts have subsequently developed into
Christian philosophy
,
Christian art
,
Christian music
,
Christian literature
, and so on.
Christianity has had a significant impact on education, as the church created the bases of the Western system of education,
[483]
and was the sponsor of
founding universities
in the Western world, as the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the
Medieval Christian
setting.
[228]
Historically, Christianity has often been a patron of science and medicine; many
Catholic clergy
,
[484]
Jesuits
in particular,
[485]
[486]
[487]
have been active in the sciences throughout history and have made significant contributions to the
development of science
.
[488]
[489]
Some scholars state that Christianity contributed to the rise of the
Scientific Revolution
.
[490]
Protestantism also has had an important influence on science. According to the
Merton Thesis
, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English
Puritanism
and German
Pietism
on the one hand, and early experimental science on the other.
[491]
[492]
[493]
The civilizing influence of Christianity includes social welfare,
[483]
contribution to the medical and health care,
[494]
founding hospitals,
[483]
economics (as the
Protestant work ethic
),
[483]
[495]
[496]
architecture,
[497]
literature,
[498]
personal hygiene
(
ablution
),
[499]
[500]
and family life.
[483]
[501]
Historically,
extended families
were the basic family unit in the
Christian culture
and
countries
.
[502]
Cultural Christians
are secular people with a Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the popular culture, art,
music
, and so on related to the religion.
[503]
Postchristianity
is the term for the decline of Christianity, particularly in
Europe
,
Canada
,
Australia

service (2017)
Christian groups and
denominations
have long expressed ideals of being reconciled, and in the 20th century, Christian ecumenism advanced in two ways.
[505]
[506]
One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the
World Evangelical Alliance
founded in 1846 in London or the
Edinburgh Missionary Conference
of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the
World Council of Churches
founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the
National Council of Churches in Australia
, which includes Catholics.
[505]
The other way was an institutional union with
united churches
, a practice that can be traced back to unions between Lutherans and Calvinists in early 19th-century Germany. Congregationalist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the
United Church of Canada
,
[507]
and in 1977 to form the
Uniting Church in Australia
. The
Church of South India
was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, and Presbyterian churches.
[508]
The
Christian Flag
is an ecumenical flag designed in the early 20th century to represent all of Christianity and
Christendom
.
[509]
The ecumenical,
monastic
Taizé Community
is notable for being composed of more than one hundred
brothers
from Protestant and Catholic traditions.
[510]
The community emphasizes the reconciliation of all denominations and its main church, located in
Taizé, Saône-et-Loire
, France, is named the "Church of Reconciliation".
[510]
The community is internationally known, attracting over 100,000 young
pilgrims
annually.
[511]
Steps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Catholic and Orthodox churches, mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their
Great Schism
in 1054;
[512]
the Anglican Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;
[513]
and some
Lutheran
and Catholic churches signing the
Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification
in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation. In 2006, the
World Methodist Council
, representing all Methodist denominations, adopted the declaration.

Criticism
A copy of the
Summa Theologica
by
Thomas Aquinas
Criticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the
Apostolic Age
, with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the
Pharisees
and
scribes
(e.g.,
and
).
[515]
In the 2nd century, Christianity was criticized by the Jews on various grounds, e.g., that the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.
[516]
Additionally, a sacrifice to remove sins in advance, for everyone or as a human being, did not fit the Jewish sacrifice ritual; furthermore,
God in Judaism
is said to judge people on their deeds instead of their beliefs.
[517]
[518]
One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher
Celsus
, who wrote
The True Word
, a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society.
[519]
[520]
[521]
In response, the church father
Origen
published his treatise
Contra Celsum
, or
Against Celsus
, a seminal work of Christian apologetics, which systematically addressed Celsus's criticisms and helped bring Christianity a level of academic respectability.
[522]
[521]
By the 3rd century, criticism of Christianity had mounted. Wild rumors about Christians were widely circulated, claiming that they were
atheists
and that, as part of their rituals, they devoured human infants and engaged in incestuous orgies.
[523]
[524]
The
Neoplatonist
philosopher
Porphyry
wrote the fifteen-volume
Adversus Christianos
as a comprehensive attack on Christianity, in part building on the teachings of
Plotinus
.
[525]
[526]
By the 12th century, the
Mishneh Torah
(i.e.,
Rabbi
Moses Maimonides
) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus, who had a physical body.
[527]
In the 19th century,
Nietzsche
began to write a series of polemics on the "unnatural" teachings of Christianity (e.g. sexual abstinence), and continued his criticism of Christianity to the end of his life.
[528]
In the 20th century, the philosopher
Bertrand Russell
expressed his criticism of Christianity in
Why I Am Not a Christian
, formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.
[529]
Criticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g.
Jewish
and
Muslim
theologians criticize the doctrine of the
Trinity
held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three gods, running against the basic tenet of
monotheism
.
[530]
New Testament scholar
Robert M. Price
has outlined the possibility that some Bible stories are based partly on myth in
The Christ Myth Theory and its problems
.
[531]
Persecution
Christians fleeing their homes in the
Ottoman Empire
,
c.
1922
. Many Christians were persecuted and killed during the
Armenian genocide
,
Greek genocide
, and
Assyrian genocide
.
[532]
Christians are one of the most
persecuted
religious groups in the world, especially in the
Middle-East
,
North Africa
and South and East Asia.
[533]
In 2017,
Open Doors
estimated approximately 260 million Christians are subjected annually to "high, very high, or extreme persecution"
[534]
with North Korea considered the most hazardous nation for Christians.
[535]
[536]
In 2019, a report
[537]
[538]
commissioned by the United Kingdom's
Secretary of State
of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(FCO) to investigate global persecution of Christians found persecution has increased, and is highest in the Middle East, North Africa, India, China, North Korea, and Latin America, among others, and that it is global and not limited to Islamic states.
[539]
[538]
This investigation found that approximately 80% of persecuted believers worldwide are Christians.
[19]
Apologetics
Christian apologetics aims to present a
rational
basis for Christianity. The word "apologetic" (Greek: ἀπολογητικός
apologētikos
) comes from the Greek verb ἀπολογέομαι
apologeomai
, meaning "(I) speak in defense of".
[540]
Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher
Thomas Aquinas
presented five arguments for God's existence in the
Summa Theologica
, while his
Summa contra Gentiles
was a major apologetic work.
[541]
[542]
Another famous apologist,
G. K. Chesterton
, wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.
[543]
[544]
He pointed to the
advance of Christian civilizations
as proof of its practicality.
[545]
The physicist and priest
John Polkinghorne
, in his
Questions of Truth
, discusses the subject of
religion and science
, a topic that other Christian apologists such as
Ravi Zacharias
,
John Lennox
, and
William Lane Craig
have engaged, with the latter two men opining that the
inflationary Big Bang model
is evidence for the
existence of God
.
[546]
Creationist apologetics
is apologetics that aims to defend
creationism
.

Îles de Los
[il

are an
island group
lying off
Conakry
in
Guinea
, on the west coast of Africa. Their name is derived from the Portuguese:
Ilhas dos Ídolos
, "Islands of the Idols".
[1]
They are located about two kilometres (one nautical mile) off the headland limiting the southern side of
Sangareya Bay
.
[2]
The islands are best known for their beaches and forested interiors and are popular with tourists. Ferries sail to the Los from Conakry.
Geography
[
edit
]
There are three main islands: Tamara (Fortoba), Kassa and Roume. Île de Corail, Île Blanche, Île Cabris, Île Poulet, Îlot Cabri and Îlot de la Bouteille are smaller islands and islets located in the southern half.
[1]
Tamara
[
edit
]
Tamara is home to the
Île Tamara Lighthouse
. The island used to have a prison.
Kassa
[
edit
]
Formerly known as Factory Island, the current name is derived from the Portuguese word "
casa
", meaning "house".
History
[
edit
]
The islands have been inhabited for a long time and rose to prominence for their role in the
Atlantic slave trade
. The
Kaloum
or
Kalum
dialect of the
Baga language
was originally spoken on the island by a group of
Baga people
.
[3]
In 1755,
Miles Barber
of the
African Company of Liverpool
established a
trading post
(then known as a
factory
) there employing workers skilled in ship repair as well as
pilots
for the local rivers. This led to Kassa being known as "Factory Island".
[4]
English-language sources in the 18th century gave various corrupted names for the islands including "Isles of Loss", "the Edlesses", "The Idols", or "Las Idolas".
[5]
In 1812
Samuel Samo
, a Dutch slave trader, was seized by the British there and taken to
Freetown
,
Sierra Leone
, where he appeared before the
Vice Admiralty Court
. He was the first person tried under the British
Slave Trade Felony Act 1811
.
[6]
(See for context the 1818
Anglo-Dutch Slave Trade Treaty
which established
Mixed Commission Courts
.)
British possession (1818-1904)
[
edit
]
Charles MacCarthy
, the
Governor of Sierra Leone
, signed a treaty with
Mangé Demba
on 6 July 1818, whereby the islands were ceded to the
British Empire
for the payment of an annual rent.
[7]
McCarthy then asked
Peter Machlan
, a surgeon with the
2nd West Indian Regiment
to write an account of the islands and surrounding areas. This was published as
Travels into the Baga and Soosoo country during the year 1821
.
[7]
Part of French Guinea (1904-1958)
[
edit
]
Following a visit by
Edward VII
to France, and a return visit by the
French President
Émile Loubet
, the French and British governments signed the
Entente Cordiale
on 7 April 1904: among many other matters, Îles de Los was handed over to France in exchange for France relinquishing
fishing rights in Newfoundland
.
[8]
The islands were incorporated into
French Guinea
, one of the constituent parts of
French West Africa
, in July 1904.
[9]
Scipio O'Connor was the first colonial administrator appointed by the French.

The recorded
history of Scotland
begins with the
arrival
of the
Roman Empire
in the
1st century
, when the
province
of
Britannia
reached as far north as the
Antonine Wall
. North of this was
Caledonia
, inhabited by the
Picti
, whose uprisings forced Rome's legions back to
Hadrian's Wall
. As Rome finally
withdrew from Britain
, a
Gaelic
tribe from
Ireland
called the
Scoti
began colonising Western Scotland and Wales. Before Roman times,
prehistoric Scotland
entered the
Neolithic Era
about 4000 BC, the
Bronze Age
about 2000 BC, and the
Iron Age
around 700 BC.
The Gaelic kingdom of
Dál Riata
was founded on the west coast of Scotland in the
6th century
. In the following century,
Irish
missionaries introduced the previously
pagan Picts
to
Celtic Christianity
. Following
England
's
Gregorian mission
, the Pictish king
Nechtan
chose to abolish most Celtic practices in favour of the
Roman rite
, restricting Gaelic influence on his kingdom and avoiding war with
Anglian
Northumbria
.
[1]
Towards the end of the 8th century, the
Viking invasions
began, forcing the Picts and Gaels to cease their historic hostility to each other and to unite in the
9th century
, forming the
Kingdom of Scotland
.
The Kingdom of Scotland was united under the
House of Alpin
, whose members fought among each other during frequent disputed successions. The last Alpin king,
Malcolm II
, died without a male issue in the early 11th century and the kingdom passed through his daughter's son to the
House of Dunkeld
or Canmore. The last Dunkeld king,
Alexander III
, died in 1286. He left only his infant granddaughter
Margaret, Maid of Norway
as heir, who died herself four years later. England, under
Edward I
, would take advantage of this questioned succession to launch a series of conquests, resulting in the
Wars of Scottish Independence
, as Scotland passed back and forth between the
House of Balliol
and the
House of Bruce
through the
late Middle Ages
. Scotland's ultimate victory confirmed Scotland as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom.
When
King David II
died in 1371 without issue, his nephew
Robert II
established the
House of Stuart
, which would rule Scotland
uncontested
for the next three centuries.
James VI
, Stuart king of Scotland, also inherited the throne of England in 1603, becoming James I of England, and this
Union of the Crowns
of the two independent kingdoms lasted until the
Acts of Union
in 1707 merged the two kingdoms into a new state, the
Kingdom of Great Britain
.
[2]
[3]
[4]
Ruling until 1714,
Queen Anne
was the last Stuart monarch. Since 1714, the succession of the
British monarchs
of the houses of
Hanover
and
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Windsor)
has been due to their descent from
James VI and I
of the House of Stuart.
During the
Scottish Enlightenment
and
Industrial Revolution
, Scotland
became
one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Later, its
industrial decline
following the Second World War was particularly acute. In recent decades Scotland has enjoyed something of a cultural
[
citation needed
]
and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent
financial services
sector and the proceeds of
North Sea oil
and gas. Since the 1950s, nationalism has become a strong political topic, with serious debates on
Scottish independence
, and a referendum in 2014 about leaving the British Union.
Pre-history
[
edit
]
Main article:
Prehistoric Scotland
The oldest standing house in Northern Europe is at
Knap of Howar
, dating from 3500 BC.
People lived in Scotland for at least 8,500 years before Britain's
recorded history
. At times during the last
interglacial period
(130,000-70,000 BC) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have made their way to Scotland, with the possible discovery of pre-
Ice Age
axes on
Orkney
and mainland Scotland.
[5]
Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BC.
[6]
Upper Paleolithic
hunter-gatherer encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near
Biggar
to around 12000 BC.
[7]
[8]
Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers.
[9]
The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at
South Queensferry
near the
Firth of Forth
, dating from the
Mesolithic
period, about 8240 BC.
[10]
The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at
Jura
, dated to about 6000 BC.
[11]
Neolithic
farming brought permanent settlements. Evidence of these includes the well-preserved stone house at
Knap of Howar
on
Papa Westray
, dating from around 3500 BC
[12]
and the village of similar houses at
Skara Brae
on West
Mainland
, Orkney from about 500 years later.
[13]
The settlers introduced
chambered cairn
tombs from around 3500 BC, as at
Maeshowe
,
[14]
and from about 3000 BC the many standing stones and circles such as those at
Stenness
on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BC, of four stones, the tallest of which is 16 feet (5 m) in height.
[15]
These were part of a pattern that developed in many regions across Europe at about the same time.
[16]
The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into the
Bronze Age
, which began in Scotland about 2000 BC.
[17]
As elsewhere in Europe,
hill forts
were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of
Eildon Hill
near Melrose in the
Scottish Borders
, from around 1000 BC, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop.
[18]
From the
Early
and
Middle Bronze Age
there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at
Jarlshof
and
Sumburgh
in Shetland.
[19]
There is also evidence of the occupation of
crannogs
, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.
[20]
In the early
Iron Age
, from the seventh century BC, cellular houses began to be replaced on the northern isles by simple
Atlantic roundhouses
, substantial circular buildings with a dry stone construction. From about 400 BC, more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and
Crosskirk
, Caithness.
[21]
The most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular
broch
towers, probably dating from about 200 BC.
[21]
This period also saw the first
wheelhouses
, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation.
[22]
There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age
hill forts in Scotland
, most located below the Clyde-Forth line,
[23]
which have suggested to some archaeologists the emergence of a society of petty rulers and warrior elites recognisable from Roman accounts.
[24]
Roman invasion

Scotland during the Roman Empire

and now in the
National Museum of Scotland
Of the surviving pre-Roman accounts of Scotland, the first written reference to Scotland was the
Greek
Pytheas
of
Massalia
, who may have circumnavigated the
British Isles
of
Albion
(
Britain
) and
Ierne
(Ireland)
[26]
[27]
sometime around 325 BC. The most northerly point of Britain was called
Orcas
(Orkney).
[28]
[29]
: 10
By the time of
Pliny the Elder
, who died in AD 79, Roman knowledge of the geography of Scotland had extended to the
Hebudes
(
The Hebrides
),
Dumna
(probably the
Outer Hebrides
), the
Caledonian Forest
and the people of the
Caledonii
, from whom the Romans named the region north of their control
Caledonia
.
[30]
Ptolemy
, possibly drawing on earlier sources of information as well as more contemporary accounts from the
Agricolan
invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland
[31]
in
his
Geography
, but many of the names are obscure and the geography becomes less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these areas was confined to observations from the sea.
[32]
The
Roman invasion of Britain
began in earnest in AD 43, leading to the establishment of the Roman province of
Britannia
in the south. By the year 71, the
Roman governor
Quintus Petillius Cerialis
had launched an invasion of what is now Scotland.
[33]
In the year 78,
Gnaeus Julius Agricola
arrived in Britain to take up his appointment as the new governor and began a series of major incursions. He is said to have pushed his armies to the estuary of the "River Taus" (usually assumed to be the
River Tay
) and established forts there, including a legionary fortress at
Inchtuthil
. After his victory over the northern tribes at
Mons Graupius
in 84, a series of forts and towers were established along the
Gask Ridge
, which marked the boundary between the Lowland and Highland zones, probably forming the first Roman
limes
or frontier in Scotland. Agricola's successors were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north.
[34]
By the year 87, the occupation was limited to the
Southern Uplands
[35]
and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the
Tyne
and
Solway Firth
.
[36]
The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as
Hadrian's Wall
from coast to coast.
[37]
Around 141, the Romans undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new
limes
between the Firth of Forth and the
Firth of Clyde
, which became the
Antonine Wall
. The largest Roman construction inside Scotland, it is a
sward
-covered wall made of
turf
around 20 feet (6 m) high, with nineteen forts. It extended for 37 miles (60 km). Having taken twelve years to build, the wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160.
[37]
[38]
The Romans retreated to the line of Hadrian's Wall.
[39]
Roman troops penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times, with at least four major campaigns.
[40]
The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor
Septimius Severus
led a
major force
north.
[41]
After the death of Severus in 210 they withdrew south to Hadrian's Wall, which would be Roman frontier until it collapsed in the 5th century.
[42]
The
Great Conspiracy
constituted a seemingly coordinated invasion against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, which included the participation of the Gaelic
Scoti
and the Caledonians, who were then known as
Picts
by the Romans. This was defeated by the
comes
Theodosius
, however, Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the
Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain
and the immigration of the
Saxons
to southeastern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.
[43]
By the close of the Roman occupation of southern and central Britain in the 5th century, the
Picts
had emerged as the dominant force in northern Scotland, with the various
Brythonic
tribes the Romans had first encountered there occupying the southern half of the country. Roman influence on Scottish culture and history was not enduring.
[44]
Post-Roman Scotland
[
edit

Main article:
Scotland in the Early Middle Ages
Clach an Tiompain
, a Pictish symbol stone in
Strathpeffer
In the centuries after the departure of the Romans from Britain, there were four groups within the borders of what is now Scotland. In the east were the Picts, with kingdoms between the river Forth and Shetland. In the late 6th century the dominant force was the Kingdom of
Fortriu
, whose lands were centred on
Strathearn
and
Menteith
and who raided along the eastern coast into modern England.
[45]
In the west were the Gaelic (
Goidelic
)-speaking people of
Dál Riata
with their royal fortress at
Dunadd
in Argyll, with close links with the island of Ireland, from whom comes the name Scots.
[45]
In the south was the British (Brythonic)
Kingdom of Strathclyde
, descendants of the peoples of the Roman influenced kingdoms of "
Hen Ogledd
" (Old north), often named Alt Clut, the Brythonic name for their capital at
Dumbarton Rock
.
[46]
Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of
Bernicia
, in the south-east.
[47]
The first English king in the historical record is
Ida
, who is said to have obtained the throne and the kingdom about 547.
[48]
Ida's grandson, Æthelfrith, united his kingdom with
Deira
to the south to form Northumbria around the year 604. There were changes of dynasty, and the kingdom was divided, but it was re-united under Æthelfrith's son
Oswald
(r. 634-642).
[49]
Scotland was largely converted to Christianity by Irish-Scots missions associated with figures such as
St Columba
, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions tended to found
monastic
institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas.
[50]
[51]
Partly as a result of these factors, some scholars have identified a distinctive form of
Celtic Christianity
, in which
abbots
were more significant than bishops, attitudes to
clerical celibacy
were more relaxed and there were some significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of
tonsure
and the method of
calculating Easter
, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-7th century.
[52]

Rise of the Kingdom of Alba
[

Main article:
Origins of the Kingdom of Alba
Conversion to Christianity may have sped a long-term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians debate whether it was a Pictish takeover of Dál Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of
Cínaed mac Ailpín
(Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the
House of Alpin
.
[54]
In 867 AD the Vikings seized the southern half of Northumbria, forming the
Kingdom of York
;
[55]
three years later they stormed the Britons' fortress of Dumbarton
[56]
and subsequently conquered much of England except for a reduced Kingdom of Wessex,
[55]
leaving the new combined Pictish and Gaelic kingdom almost encircled.
[57]
When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900,
Domnall II
(Donald II) was the first man to be called
rí Alban
(i.e.
King of Alba
).
[58]
The term Scotia was increasingly used to describe the kingdom between North of the Forth and Clyde and eventually the entire area controlled by its kings was referred to as Scotland.

The long reign (900-942/3) of
Causantín
(Constantine II) is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at
Brunanburh
was followed by his retirement as a
Culdee
monk at St. Andrews.
[60]
The period between the accession of his successor
Máel Coluim I
(Malcolm I) and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda (Malcolm II) was marked by good relations with the
Wessex
rulers of England
, intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, Máel Coluim I annexed Strathclyde as part of a deal with King
Edmund of England
, where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later 9th century,
[61]
an event offset somewhat by loss of control in Moray. The reign of King
Donnchad I
(Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by
MacBeth
, the
Mormaer of Moray
, who became king in 1040.
[62]
MacBeth ruled for seventeen years before he was overthrown by
Máel Coluim
, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeth's
step-son
and successor Lulach to become King Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III).
[63]
It was Máel Coluim III, who acquired the nickname "Canmore" (
Cenn Mór
, "Great Chief"), which he passed to his successors and who did most to create the
Dunkeld dynasty
that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Particularly important was his second marriage to the Anglo-Hungarian princess
Margaret
.
[64]
This marriage, and raids on northern England, prompted
William the Conqueror
to invade and Máel Coluim submitted to his authority, opening up Scotland to later claims of sovereignty by English kings.
[65]
When Malcolm died in 1093, his brother
Domnall III
(Donald III) succeeded him. However,
William II of England
backed Máel Coluim's son by his first marriage,
Donnchad
, as a pretender to the throne and he seized power. His murder within a few months saw Domnall restored with one of Máel Coluim sons by his second marriage,
Edmund
, as his heir. The two ruled Scotland until two of Edmund's younger brothers returned from exile in England, again with English military backing. Victorious,
Edgar
, the oldest of the three, became king in 1097.
[66]
Shortly afterwards Edgar and the King of Norway,
Magnus Barefoot
concluded a treaty recognising Norwegian authority over the Western Isles. In practice Norse control of the Isles was loose, with local chiefs enjoying a high degree of independence. He was succeeded by his brother
Alexander
, who reigned 1107-1124.

When Alexander died in 1124, the crown passed to Margaret's fourth son
David I
, who had spent most of his life as a Norman French baron in England. His reign saw what has been characterised as a "
Davidian Revolution
", by which native institutions and personnel were replaced by English and French ones, underpinning the development of later Medieval Scotland.
[68]
[69]
Members of the Anglo-Norman nobility took up places in the Scottish aristocracy and he introduced a system of
feudal
land tenure, which produced
knight service
, castles and an available body of heavily armed cavalry. He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of
justicar
to oversee justice, and local offices of
sheriffs
to administer localities. He established the first
royal burghs
in Scotland, granting rights to particular settlements, which led to the development of the first true Scottish towns and helped facilitate economic development as did the introduction of the first recorded Scottish coinage. He continued a process begun by his mother and brothers helping to establish foundations that brought reform to Scottish monasticism based on those at
Cluny
and he played a part in organising diocese on lines closer to those in the rest of Western Europe.
[70]
These reforms were pursued under his successors and grandchildren
Malcolm IV of Scotland
and
William I
, with the crown now passing down the main line of descent through primogeniture, leading to the first of a series of minorities.
[66]
The benefits of greater authority were reaped by William's son
Alexander II
and his son
Alexander III
, who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following
Haakon Haakonarson
's ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the
Battle of Largs
with the
Treaty of Perth
in 1266.

The Wars of Independence
[
edit
]
Main article:
Wars of Scottish Independence
The death of King Alexander III in 1286, and the death of his granddaughter and heir
Margaret, Maid of Norway
in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked
Edward I of England
to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing
John Balliol
, the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292.
[72]
Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale
, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.
[73]
In 1295, John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France, known as the
Auld Alliance
.
[74]
Edward I of England, 'Hammer of the Scots', depicted on a late-15thC woodcut.
In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year
William Wallace
and
Andrew de Moray
raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the
Battle of Stirling Bridge
. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the
Battle of Falkirk
in 1298.
[75]
Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305, he fell into the hands of the English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he owed no allegiance to England.
[76]
Rivals
John Comyn
and
Robert the Bruce
, grandson of the claimant, were appointed as joint guardians in his place.
[77]
[78]
On 10 February 1306, Bruce participated in the murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in
Dumfries
.
[79]
Less than seven weeks later, on 25 March, Bruce was crowned as King. However, Edward's forces overran the country after defeating Bruce's small army at the
Battle of Methven
.
[80]
Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by
Pope Clement V
, his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir
James Douglas
and
Thomas Randolph
only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling remained under English control.
[81]
Edward I had died in 1307. His heir
Edward II
moved an army north to break the siege of
Stirling Castle
and reassert control. Robert defeated that army at the
Battle of Bannockburn
in 1314, securing
de facto
independence.
[82]
In 1320, the
Declaration of Arbroath
, a remonstrance to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince
Pope John XXII
to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The Declaration has also been seen as one of the most important documents in the development of a Scottish national identity.
[83]
In 1326, what may have been the first full
Parliament of Scotland
met. The parliament had evolved from an earlier council of nobility and clergy, the
colloquium
, constituted around 1235, but perhaps in 1326 representatives of the
burghs
- the burgh commissioners - joined them to form the
Three Estates
.
[84]
[85]
In 1328,
Edward III
signed the
Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton
acknowledging
Scottish independence
under the rule of Robert the Bruce.
[86]
However, four years after Robert's death in 1329, England once more invaded on the pretext of restoring
Edward Balliol
, son of John Balliol, to the Scottish throne, thus starting the Second War of Independence.
[86]
Despite victories at
Dupplin Moor
and
Halidon Hill
, in the face of tough Scottish resistance led by
Sir Andrew Murray
, the son of Wallace's comrade in arms, successive attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed.
[86]
Edward III lost interest in the fate of his protégé after the outbreak of the
Hundred Years' War
with France.
[86]
In 1341,
David II
, King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364.

The Stuarts

Main article:
House of Stuart
Highlands in 1482
Heraldic depiction of the King of Scots from a 15th-century French armorial
After David II's death,
Robert II
, the first of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was followed in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the
regnal name
Robert III
. During Robert III's reign (1390-1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother,
Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany
.
[88]
After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future
James I
, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son
Murdoch
. When Scotland finally paid the ransom in 1424, James, aged 32, returned with his English bride determined to assert his authority.
[88]
Several of the Albany family were executed; but he succeeded in centralising control in the hands of the crown, at the cost of increasing unpopularity, and was assassinated in 1437. His son
James II
(reigned 1437-1460), when he came of age in 1449, continued his father's policy of weakening the great noble families, most notably taking on the powerful
Black Douglas family
that had come to prominence at the time of the Bruce.
[88]
In 1468, the last significant acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when
James III
was engaged to
Margaret of Denmark
, receiving the
Orkney Islands
and the
Shetland Islands
in payment of her dowry.
[89]
Berwick upon Tweed
was
captured by England in 1482
. With the death of James III in 1488 at the
Battle of Sauchieburn
, his successor
James IV
successfully ended the quasi-independent rule of the
Lord of the Isles
, bringing the Western Isles under effective Royal control for the first time.
[88]
In 1503, he married
Margaret Tudor
, daughter of
Henry VII of England
, thus laying the foundation for the 17th-century
Union of the Crowns
.
[90]
Scotland advanced markedly in educational terms during the 15th century with the founding of the
University of St Andrews
in 1413, the
University of Glasgow
in 1450 and the
University of Aberdeen
in 1495, and with the passing of the
Education Act 1496
, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools.
[91]
James IV's reign is often considered to have seen a flowering of Scottish culture under the influence of the European
Renaissance
.
[92]
View from the royal apartments of the Stewart monarchs, Edinburgh Castle.
In 1512, the Auld Alliance was renewed and under its terms, when the French were attacked by the English under
Henry VIII
, James IV invaded England in support. The invasion was stopped decisively at the
Battle of Flodden Field
during which the King, many of his nobles, and a large number of ordinary troops were killed, commemorated by the song
Flowers of the Forest
. Once again Scotland's government lay in the hands of regents in the name of the infant
James V
.
[93]
James V finally managed to escape from the custody of the regents in 1528. He continued his father's policy of subduing the rebellious
Highlands
, Western and Northern isles and the troublesome borders.
[94]
He also continued the French alliance, marrying first the French noblewoman
Madeleine of Valois
and then after her death
Marie of Guise
.
[94]
James V's domestic and foreign policy successes were overshadowed by another disastrous campaign against England that led to defeat at the
Battle of Solway Moss
(1542).
[94]
James died a short time later, a demise blamed by contemporaries on "a broken heart". The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who would become
Mary, Queen of Scots
.
[95]
Once again, Scotland was in the hands of a regent. Within two years, the
Rough Wooing
began, Henry VIII's military attempt to force a marriage between Mary and his son,
Edward
. This took the form of border skirmishing and several English campaigns into Scotland. In 1547, after the death of Henry VIII, forces under the English regent
Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset
were victorious at the
Battle of Pinkie Cleugh
, the climax of the Rough Wooing, and followed up by the occupation of
Haddington
. Mary was then sent to France at the age of five, as the intended bride of the heir to the French throne. Her mother, Marie de Guise, stayed in Scotland to look after the interests of Mary - and of France - although the
Earl of Arran
acted officially as regent.
[96]
Guise responded by calling on French troops, who helped stiffen resistance to the English occupation. By 1550, after a change of regent in England, the English withdrew from Scotland completely.
From 1554 on, Marie de Guise took over the regency and continued to advance French interests in Scotland. French cultural influence resulted in a large influx of French vocabulary into
Scots
. But anti-French sentiment also grew, particularly among
Protestants
, who saw the English as their natural allies. This led to armed conflict at the
siege of Leith
. Marie de Guise died in June 1560, and soon after the Auld Alliance also ended, with the signing of the
Treaty of Edinburgh
, which provided for the removal of French and English troops from Scotland. The
Scottish Reformation
took place only days later when the
Scottish Parliament
abolished the
Roman Catholic
religion and outlawed the
Mass
.
[97]
Depiction of
David Rizzio
's murder in 1566
Meanwhile, Queen Mary had been raised as a Catholic in France, and married to the
Dauphin
, who became king as
Francis II
in 1559, making her queen consort of France.
[98]
When Francis died in 1560, Mary, now 19, returned to Scotland to take up the government. Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary,
David Riccio
, was followed by that of her unpopular second husband
Lord Darnley
, and her abduction by and marriage to the
Earl of Bothwell
, who was implicated in Darnley's murder.
[99]
Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at
Carberry Hill
and after their forces melted away, he fled and she was captured by Bothwell's rivals. Mary was imprisoned in
Lochleven Castle
, and in July 1567, was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son
James VI
.
[100]
Mary eventually escaped and attempted to regain the throne by force. After her defeat at the
Battle of Langside
in 1568, she took refuge in England, leaving her young son in the hands of regents. In Scotland the regents fought a
civil war
on behalf of James VI against his mother's supporters. In England, Mary became a focal point for Catholic conspirators and was eventually tried for treason and executed on the orders of her kinswoman Elizabeth I.
[101]
[102]
Protestant Reformation
[
edit
]
Main article:
Scottish Reformation
In 1559,
John Knox
returned from ministering in
Geneva
to lead the
Calvinist
reformation in Scotland.
During the 16th century, Scotland underwent a
Protestant Reformation
that created a predominantly Calvinist national Kirk, which became Presbyterian in outlook and severely reduced the powers of bishops. In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first
Martin Luther
and then
John Calvin
began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars, often training for the priesthood, who had visited Continental universities. The Lutheran preacher
Patrick Hamilton
was executed for heresy in
St. Andrews
in 1528.
[103]
The execution of others, especially the
Zwingli
-influenced
George Wishart
, who was burnt at the stake on the orders of
Cardinal Beaton
in 1546, angered Protestants. Wishart's supporters assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain
John Knox
, were condemned to be galley slaves in France, stoking resentment of the French and creating martyrs for the Protestant cause.
[104]
Limited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves
Lords of the Congregation
in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by
Parliament in 1560
, while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France.
[105]
Knox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva as a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure of the period. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. The reformed Kirk gave considerable power to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy. There were widespread, but generally orderly outbreaks of
iconoclasm
. At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the Kirk found it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.
[106]
Women shared in the religiosity of the day. The egalitarian and emotional aspects of Calvinism appealed to men and women alike. Historian Alasdair Raffe finds that, "Men and women were thought equally likely to be among the elect....Godly men valued the prayers and conversation of their female co-religionists, and this reciprocity made for loving marriages and close friendships between men and women." Furthermore, there was an increasingly intense relationship in the pious bonds between minister and his women parishioners. For the first time, laywomen gained numerous new religious roles and took a prominent place in prayer societies.

Union of the Crowns
In 1603,
James VI King of Scots
inherited the throne of the
Kingdom of England
and became King James I of England, leaving
Edinburgh
for London and uniting England with Scotland under one monarch.
[108]
The Union was a
personal
or
dynastic union
, with the
Crowns
remaining both distinct and separate—despite James's best efforts to create a new "imperial" throne of "Great Britain".
[109]
The acquisition of the Irish crown along with the English facilitated a process of settlement by Scots in what was historically the most troublesome area of the kingdom in
Ulster
, with perhaps 50,000 Scots settling in the province by the mid-17th century.
[110]
James adopted a different approach to impose his authority in the western Highlands and Islands. The additional military resource that was now available, particularly the English navy, resulted in the enactment of the
Statutes of Iona
which compelled integration of Hebridean clan leaders with the rest of Scottish society.

Bishops' Wars
The
St. Giles
riot initiated by
Jenny Geddes
sparked off the Bishops' Wars.
Although James had tried to get the Scottish Church to accept some of the High Church Anglicanism of his southern kingdom, he met with limited success. His son and successor,
Charles I
, took matters further, introducing an English-style Prayer Book into the Scottish church in 1637. This resulted in anger and widespread rioting. (The story goes that it was initiated by a certain
Jenny Geddes
who threw a stool in
St Giles Cathedral
.)
[113]
Representatives of various sections of Scottish society drew up the
National Covenant
in 1638, objecting to the King's liturgical innovations. In November of the same year matters were taken even further, when at a meeting of the General Assembly in Glasgow the Scottish bishops were formally expelled from the Church, which was then established on a full Presbyterian basis.
[114]
Charles gathered a military force; but as neither side wished to push the matter to a full military conflict, a temporary settlement was concluded at
Pacification of Berwick
.
[114]
Matters remained unresolved until 1640 when, in a renewal of hostilities, Charles's northern forces were defeated by the Scots at the
Battle of Newburn
to the west of Newcastle.
[115]
During the course of these Bishops' Wars Charles tried to raise an army of Irish Catholics, but was forced to back down after a storm of protest in Scotland and England. The backlash from this venture provoked a
rebellion in Ireland
and Charles was forced to appeal to the English Parliament for funds. Parliament's demands for reform in England eventually resulted in the
English Civil War
. This series of civil wars that engulfed England, Ireland and Scotland in the 1640s and 1650s is known to modern historians as the
Wars of the Three Kingdoms
.
[116]
The
Covenanters
meanwhile, were left governing Scotland, where they raised a large army of their own and tried to impose their religious settlement on
Episcopalians
and
Roman Catholics
in the north of the country. In England his religious policies caused similar resentment and he ruled without recourse to parliament from 1629.

James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose
, who led a successful pro-royalist campaign in the Highlands in 1644-1646.
As the civil wars developed, the English
Parliamentarians
appealed to the Scots Covenanters for military aid against the King. A
Solemn League and Covenant
was entered into, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England.
[118]
Scottish troops played a major part in the defeat of Charles I, notably at the
battle of Marston Moor
. An army under the Earl of Leven occupied the North of England for some time.
[119]
However, not all Scots supported the Covenanter's taking arms against their King. In 1644,
James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose
attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the
Irish Confederates
under
Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla)
, and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A
Scottish Civil War
began in September 1644 with his victory at
battle of Tippermuir
. After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the
Battle of Philiphaugh
. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end.
[120]
The following year Charles, while he was being held captive in Carisbrooke Castle, entered into an agreement with moderate Scots Presbyterians. In this secret '
Engagement
', the Scots promised military aid in return for the King's agreement to implement Presbyterianism in England on a three-year trial basis. The
Duke of Hamilton
led an invasion of England to free the King, but he was defeated by
Oliver Cromwell
in August 1648 at the Battle of Preston.

The
execution of Charles I
in 1649 was carried out in the face of objections by the Covenanter government and his son was immediately proclaimed as King
Charles II
in Edinburgh. Oliver Cromwell led an invasion of Scotland in 1650, and defeated the Scottish army at
Dunbar
and then defeated a Scottish invasion of England at
Worcester
on 3 September 1651 (the anniversary of his victory at Dunbar). Cromwell emerged as the leading figure in the English government and Scotland was occupied by an English force under
George Monck
. The country was incorporated into the Puritan-governed
Commonwealth
and lost its independent church government, parliament and legal system, but gained access to English markets.
[122]
Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657 (see
Tender of Union
).
[123]
After the death of Cromwell and the regime's collapse, Charles II was restored in 1660 and Scotland again became an independent kingdom.
[124]
Scotland regained its system of law, parliament and kirk, but also the
Lords of the Articles
(by which the crown managed parliament), bishops and a king who did not visit the country. He ruled largely without reference to Parliament, through a series of commissioners. These began with
John, Earl of Middleton
and ended with the king's brother and heir,
James, Duke of York
(known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany).
[125]
The
English Navigation Acts
prevented the Scots engaging in what would have been lucrative trading with England's colonies.
[126]
The restoration of episcopacy was a source of trouble, particularly in the south-west of the country, an area with strong Presbyterian sympathies. Abandoning the official church, many of the inhabitants began to attend illegal field assemblies, known as
conventicles
.
[127]
Official attempts to suppress these led to a rising in 1679, defeated by
James, Duke of Monmouth
, the King's illegitimate son, at the
Battle of Bothwell Bridge
.
[128]
In the early 1680s a more intense phase of persecution began, later to be called "
the Killing Time
". When Charles died in 1685 and his brother, a Roman Catholic, succeeded him as
James VII of Scotland (and II of England)
, matters came to a head.

to Roman Catholics, alienating his Protestant subjects. It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of
William of Orange
, Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir,
James Francis Edward Stuart
, it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless "
Glorious Revolution
". The Estates issued a
Claim of Right
that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power.
[124]
The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops who had generally supported James. However, William, who was more tolerant than the Kirk tended to be, passed acts restoring the Episcopalian clergy excluded after the Revolution.
[130]
Although William's supporters dominated the government, there remained a significant following for James, particularly in the Highlands. His cause, which became known as
Jacobitism
, from the Latin
(Jacobus)
for James, led to a series of risings. An initial Jacobite military attempt was led by
John Graham, Viscount Dundee
. His forces, almost all Highlanders, defeated William's forces at the
Battle of Killiecrankie
in 1689, but they took heavy losses and Dundee was slain in the fighting. Without his leadership the Jacobite army was soon defeated at the
Battle of Dunkeld
.
[131]
In the aftermath of the Jacobite defeat on 13 February 1692, in an incident since known as the
Massacre of Glencoe
, 38 members of the
Clan MacDonald of Glencoe
were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, on the grounds that they had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs.

Economic crisis of the 1690s

Main article:
Seven ill years
The colony of New Caledonia on the Isthmus of Darien
The closing decade of the 17th century saw the generally favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the Restoration come to an end. There was a slump in trade with the Baltic and France from 1689 to 1691, caused by French protectionism and changes in the Scottish cattle trade, followed by four years of failed harvests (1695, 1696 and 1698-1699), an era known as the "seven ill years".
[133]
The result was severe famine and depopulation, particularly in the north.
[134]
The Parliament of Scotland of 1695 enacted proposals to help the desperate economic situation, including setting up the
Bank of Scotland
. The
"Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies"
received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.
[135]
Failure of Darien scheme

Main article:
Darien scheme
With the dream of building a lucrative overseas colony for Scotland, the Company of Scotland invested in the
Darien scheme
, an ambitious plan devised by
William Paterson
to establish a colony on the
Isthmus of Panama
in the hope of establishing trade with the Far East.
[136]
The Darién scheme won widespread support in Scotland as the landed gentry and the merchant class were in agreement in seeing overseas trade and colonialism as routes to upgrade Scotland's economy. Since the capital resources of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower classes volunteered as colonists.
[137]
But the English government opposed the idea: involved in the
War of the Grand Alliance
from 1689 to 1697 against France, it did not want to offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of
New Granada
. The English investors withdrew. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised 400,000 pounds in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3,000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; under attack by the Spanish from nearby
Cartagena
; and refused aid by the English in the
West Indies
, the colonists abandoned their project in 1700. Only 1,000 survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland.

Union flag, combining the
Cross of St George
of England, with the
Cross of St. Andrew
of Scotland.
Scotland was a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million in 1755. Although Scotland lost home rule, the Union allowed it to break free of a stultifying system and opened the way for the
Scottish enlightenment
as well as a great expansion of trade and increase in opportunity and wealth. Edinburgh economist
Adam Smith
concluded in 1776 that "By the union with England, the middling and inferior ranks of people in Scotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy which had always before oppressed them."
[138]
Historian
Jonathan Israel
holds that the Union "proved a decisive catalyst politically and economically," by allowing ambitious Scots entry on an equal basis to a rich expanding empire and its increasing trade.
[139]
Scotland's transformation into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly in the next 150 years, following its union with England in 1707 and its integration with the advanced English and imperial economies.
[140]
The transformation was led by two cities that grew rapidly after 1770.
Glasgow
, on the river Clyde, was
the base for
the tobacco and sugar trade with an emerging textile industry.
Edinburgh
was the administrative and intellectual centre where the Scottish Enlightenment was chiefly based.

Union with England

Main article:
Acts of Union 1707
By the start of the 18th century, a
political union
between Scotland and England became politically and economically attractive, promising to open up the much larger markets of England, as well as those of the growing English Empire. With economic stagnation since the late 17th century, which was particularly acute in 1704, the country depended more and more heavily on sales of cattle and linen to England, who used this to create pressure for a union.
[142]
[143]
The Scottish parliament voted on 6 January 1707, by 110 to 69, to adopt the
Treaty of Union
. It was also a full economic union; indeed, most of its 25 articles dealt with economic arrangements for the new state known as "Great Britain". It added 45 Scots to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords, and ended the Scottish parliament. It also replaced the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade with laws made in London. Scottish law remained separate from English law, and the religious system was not changed. England had about five times the population of Scotland at the time, and about 36 times as much wealth.

Jacobitism

Main article:
Jacobitism
Charles Edward Stuart
, known as
The Young Pretender
and
Bonnie Prince Charlie
, who led the '45 rising
Jacobitism was revived by the unpopularity of the union.
[145]
In 1708, James Francis Edward Stuart, the son of James VII, who became known as "The Old Pretender", attempted an invasion with a French fleet carrying 6,000 men, but the Royal Navy prevented it from landing troops.
[146]
A more serious attempt occurred in 1715, soon after the death of Anne and the accession of the first Hanoverian king, the eldest son of Sophie, as
George I of Great Britain
. This rising (known as
The 'Fifteen
) envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales, Devon, and Scotland. However, government arrests forestalled the southern ventures. In Scotland, John Erskine,
Earl of Mar
, nicknamed
Bobbin' John
, raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier. Mar captured Perth, but let a smaller government force under the
Duke of Argyll
hold the Stirling plain. Part of Mar's army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the
Battle of Preston
, surrendering on 14 November 1715. The day before, Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the
Battle of Sheriffmuir
. At this point, James belatedly landed in Scotland, but was advised that the cause was hopeless. He fled back to France. An attempted Jacobite invasion with Spanish assistance in 1719 met with little support from the clans and ended in defeat at the
Battle of Glen Shiel
.
[147]
In 1745, the Jacobite rising known as
The 'Forty-Five
began.
Charles Edward Stuart
, son of the
Old Pretender
, often referred to as
Bonnie Prince Charlie
or the
Young Pretender
, landed on the island of
Eriskay
in the
Outer Hebrides
.
[148]
Several clans unenthusiastically joined him. At the outset he was successful, taking Edinburgh
[149]
and then defeating the only government army in Scotland at the
Battle of Prestonpans
.
[150]
The Jacobite army marched into England, took Carlisle and advanced as far as south as Derby. However, it became increasingly evident that England would not support a Roman Catholic Stuart monarch. The Jacobite leadership had a crisis of confidence and they retreated to Scotland as two English armies closed in and Hanoverian troops began to return from the continent.
[151]
Charles' position in Scotland began to deteriorate as the Whig supporters rallied and regained control of Edinburgh. After an unsuccessful attempt on Stirling, he retreated north towards Inverness. He was pursued by the
Duke of Cumberland
and gave battle with an exhausted army at
Culloden
on 16 April 1746, where the Jacobite cause was crushed.
[152]
Charles hid in Scotland with the aid of Highlanders until September 1746, when he escaped back to France.
[153]
There were bloody reprisals against his supporters and foreign powers abandoned the Jacobite cause, with the court in exile forced to leave France. The Old Pretender died in 1766 and the Young Pretender, without legitimate issue, in 1788. When his brother,
Henry, Cardinal of York
, died in 1807, the Jacobite cause was at an end.
[154]
Post-Jacobite politics
[
edit
]
Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll
, and dominant political figure in Scotland, 1720s-61.
With the advent of the
Union
and the demise of Jacobitism, access to London and the Empire opened up very attractive career opportunities for ambitious middle-class and upper-class Scots, who seized the chance to become entrepreneurs, intellectuals, and soldiers.
[155]
Thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent
British Empire
. Historian Neil Davidson notes that "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland". Davidson also states that "far from being ‘peripheral’ to the British economy, Scotland - or more precisely, the Lowlands - lay at its core".
[156]
British officials especially appreciated Scottish soldiers. As the Secretary of War told Parliament in 1751, "I am for having always in our army as many Scottish soldiers as possible...because they are generally more hardy and less mutinous".
[157]
The national policy of aggressively recruiting Scots for senior civilian positions stirred up resentment among Englishmen, ranging from violent diatribes by
John Wilkes
, to vulgar jokes and obscene cartoons in the popular press,
[158]
and the haughty ridicule by intellectuals such as
Samuel Johnson
that was much resented by Scots. In his great
Dictionary
Johnson defined oats as, "a grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people." To which Lord Elibank retorted, "Very true, and where will you find such men and such horses?"
[159]
Scottish politics in the late 18th century was dominated by the
Whigs
, with the benign management of
Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll
(1682-1761), who was in effect the "viceroy of Scotland" from the 1720s until his death in 1761. Scotland generally supported the king with enthusiasm during the
American Revolution
.
Henry Dundas
(1742-1811) dominated political affairs in the latter part of the century. Dundas defeated advocates of intellectual and social change through his ruthless manipulation of patronage in alliance with Prime Minister
William Pitt the Younger
, until he lost power in 1806.
[160]
The main unit of local government was the parish, and since it was also part of the church, the elders imposed public humiliation for what the locals considered immoral behaviour, including fornication, drunkenness, wife beating, cursing and Sabbath breaking. The main focus was on the poor and the landlords ("lairds") and gentry, and their servants, were not subject to the parish's control. The policing system weakened after 1800 and disappeared in most places by the 1850s.
[161]
Collapse of the clan system
[
edit
]
See also:
Scottish clan
The remains of old run rig strips beside Loch Eynort, Isle of Skye. Run rig was the pre-clearance method of arable farming before agricultural improvements were introduced.
The clan system of the Highlands and Islands had been seen as a challenge to the rulers of Scotland from before the 17th century.
James VI's
various measures to exert control included the
Statutes of Iona
, an attempt to force clan leaders to become integrated into the rest of Scottish society. This started a slow process of change which, by the second half of the 18th century, saw clan chiefs start to think of themselves as commercial landlords, rather than as patriarchs of their people. To their tenants, initially this meant that monetary rents replaced those paid in kind. Later, rent increases became common.
[162]
: 11-17
In the 1710s the Dukes of Argyll started putting leases of some of their land up for auction; by 1737 this was done across the Argyll property. This commercial attitude replaced the principle of
dùthchas
, which included the obligation on clan chiefs to provide land for clan members. The shift of this attitude slowly spread through the Highland elite (but not among their tenants).
[162]
: 41
As clan chiefs became more integrated into Scottish and British society, many of them built up large debts. It became easier to borrow against the security of a Highland estate from the 1770s onwards. As the lenders became predominantly people and organisations outside the Highlands, there was a greater willingness to foreclose if the borrower defaulted. Combined with an astounding level of financial incompetence among the Highland elite, this ultimately forced the sale of the estates of many Highland landed families over the period 1770-1850. (The greatest number of sales of whole estates was toward the end of this period.)

The Jacobite rebellion of 1745 gave a final period of importance to the ability of Highland clans to raise bodies of fighting men at short notice. With the defeat at Culloden, any enthusiasm for continued warfare disappeared and clan leaders returned to their transition to being commercial landlords. This was arguably accelerated by some of the punitive laws enacted after the rebellion.
[164]
These included the
Heritable Jurisdictions Act
of 1746, which removed judicial roles from clan chiefs and gave them to the Scottish law courts.
T. M. Devine
warns against seeing a clear cause and effect relationship between the post-Culloden legislation and the collapse of clanship. He questions the basic effectiveness of the measures, quoting
W. A. Speck
who ascribes the pacification of the area more to "a disinclination to rebel than to the government's repressive measures." Devine points out that social change in Gaeldom did not pick up until the 1760s and 1770s, as this coincided with the increased market pressures from the industrialising and urbanising Lowlands.
[162]
: 30-31
41 properties belonging to rebels were forfeited to the Crown in the aftermath of the '45. The vast majority of these were sold by auction to pay creditors. 13 were retained and managed on behalf of the government between 1752 and 1784.
The changes by the Dukes of Argyll in the 1730s displaced many of the
tacksmen
in the area. From the 1770s onwards, this became a matter of policy throughout the Highlands. The restriction on subletting by tacksmen meant that landlords received all the rent paid by the actual farming tenants - thereby increasing their income. By the early part of the 19th century, the tacksman had become a rare component of Highland society.
T. M. Devine
describes "the displacement of this class as one of the clearest demonstrations of the death of the old Gaelic society."
[162]
: 34
Many emigrated, leading parties of their tenants to North America. These tenants were from the better off part of Highland peasant society, and, together with the tacksmen, they took their capital and entrepreneurial energy to the New World, unwilling to participate in economic changes imposed by their landlords which often involved a loss of status for the tenant.
[162]

Agricultural improvement
was introduced across the Highlands over the relatively short period of 1760-1850. The evictions involved in this became known as the
Highland clearances
. There was regional variation. In the east and south of the Highlands, the old townships or
bailtean
, which were farmed under the
run rig
system were replaced by larger enclosed farms, with fewer people holding leases and proportionately more of the population working as employees on these larger farms. (This was broadly similar to the situation in the Lowlands.) In the north and west, including the Hebrides, as land was taken out of run rig,
Crofting
communities were established. Much of this change involved establishing large pastoral sheep farms, with the old displaced tenants moving to new crofts in coastal areas or on poor quality land. Sheep farming was increasingly profitable at the end of the 18th century, so could pay substantially higher rents than the previous tenants. Particularly in the Hebrides, some crofting communities were established to work in the kelp industry. Others were engaged in fishing. Croft sizes were kept small, so that the occupiers were forced to seek employment to supplement what they could grow.
[162]
: 32-52
This increased the number of seasonal migrant workers travelling to the Lowlands. The resulting connection with the Lowlands was highly influential on all aspects of Highland life, touching on income levels, social attitudes and language. Migrant working gave an advantage in speaking English, which came to be considered "the language of work".
[162]
: 135, 110-117
In 1846 the
Highland potato famine
struck the crofting communities of the North and West Highlands. By 1850 the charitable relief effort was wound up, despite the continuing crop failure, and landlords, charities and the government resorted to encouraging emigration. The overall result was that almost 11,000 people were provided with "assisted passages" by their landlords between 1846 and 1856, with the greatest number travelling in 1851. A further 5,000 emigrated to Australia, through the
Highland and Island Emigration Society
. To this should be added an unknown, but significant number, who paid their own fares to emigrate, and a further unknown number assisted by the
Colonial Land and Emigration Commission
.

This was out of a famine-affected population of about 200,000 people. Many of those who remained became even more involved in temporary migration for work in the Lowlands, both out of necessity during the famine and having become accustomed to working away by the time the famine ceased. Much longer periods were spent out of the Highlands - often for much of the year or more. One illustration of this migrant working was the estimated 30,000 men and women from the far west of the Gaelic speaking area who travelled to the east coast fishing ports for the herring fishing season - providing labour in an industry that grew by 60% between 1854 and 1884.
[111]
: 335-336
The clearances were followed by a period of even greater emigration from the Highlands, which continued (with a brief lull for the First World War) up to the start of the
Great Depression

Enlightenment
[

Adam Smith
, the father of modern economics.
Main article:
Scottish Enlightenment
Historian
Jonathan Israel
argues that by 1750 Scotland's major cities had created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment ."
[167]
[168]
In France
Voltaire
said "we look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilization," and the Scots in turn paid close attention to French ideas.
[169]
Historian Bruce Lenman says their "central achievement was a new capacity to recognize and interpret social patterns."
[170]
The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was
Francis Hutcheson
, who held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. A moral philosopher who produced alternatives to the ideas of
Thomas Hobbes
, one of his major contributions to world thought was the
utilitarian
and
consequentialist
principle that virtue is that which provides, in his words, "the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers". Much of what is incorporated in the
scientific method
(the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés
David Hume
and
Adam Smith
.
[171]
Hume became a major figure in the
skeptical philosophical
and
empiricist
traditions of philosophy. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what he called a '
science of man
',
[172]
which was expressed historically in works by authors including
James Burnett
,
Adam Ferguson
,
John Millar
and
William Robertson
, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of
modernity
. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement
[173]
and Hume's philosophical concepts that directly influenced
James Madison
(and thus the US Constitution) and when popularised by
Dugald Stewart
, would be the basis of classical liberalism.
[174]
Adam Smith published
The Wealth of Nations
, often considered the first work on modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and in the 21st century still framed discussions on
globalisation
and tariffs.
[175]
The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of the physician and chemist
William Cullen
, the agriculturalist and economist
James Anderson
,
[176]
chemist and physician
Joseph Black
, natural historian
John Walker
[177]
and
James Hutton

Beginnings of industrialisation
[

Main article:
Economic history of Scotland
Former Head Office of the
British Linen Bank
in St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. Now offices of the Bank of Scotland.
With tariffs with England now abolished, the potential for trade for Scottish merchants was considerable. However, Scotland in 1750 was still a poor rural, agricultural society with a population of 1.3 million.
[179]
Some progress was visible: agriculture in the Lowlands was steadily upgraded after 1700 and standards remained high.
[180]
There were the sales of linen and cattle to England, the cash flows from military service, and the tobacco trade that was dominated by Glasgow
Tobacco Lords
after 1740.
[181]
Merchants who profited from the American trade began investing in leather, textiles, iron, coal, sugar, rope, sailcloth, glassworks, breweries, and soapworks, setting the foundations for the city's emergence as a leading industrial centre after 1815.
[182]
The tobacco trade collapsed during the American Revolution (1776-1783), when its sources were cut off by the British blockade of American ports. However, trade with the West Indies began to make up for the loss of the tobacco business,
[144]
reflecting the British demand for sugar and the demand in the West Indies for herring and linen goods.
[183]
Linen was Scotland's premier industry in the 18th century and formed the basis for the later
cotton
,
jute
,
[184]
and woollen industries.
[185]
Scottish industrial policy was made by the board of trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland, which sought to build an economy complementary, not competitive, with England. Since England had woollens, this meant linen. Encouraged and subsidised by the Board of Trustees so it could compete with German products, merchant entrepreneurs became dominant in all stages of linen manufacturing and built up the market share of Scottish linens, especially in the American colonial market.
[186]
The British Linen Company, established in 1746, was the largest firm in the Scottish linen industry in the 18th century, exporting linen to England and America. As a joint-stock company, it had the right to raise funds through the issue of promissory notes or bonds. With its bonds functioning as bank notes, the company gradually moved into the business of lending and discounting to other linen manufacturers, and in the early 1770s banking became its main activity.
[187]
It joined the established Scottish banks such as the Bank of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1695) and the
Royal Bank of Scotland
(Edinburgh, 1727).
[188]
Glasgow would soon follow and Scotland had a flourishing financial system by the end of the century. There were over 400 branches, amounting to one office per 7,000 people, double the level in England, where banks were also more heavily regulated. Historians have emphasised that the flexibility and dynamism of the Scottish banking system contributed significantly to the rapid development of the economy in the 19th century.
[189]
[190]
German sociologist
Max Weber
mentioned Scottish Presbyterianism in
The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism
(1905), and many scholars argued that "this worldly asceticism" of Calvinism was integral to Scotland's rapid economic modernisation.
[191]
More recent scholarship however emphasises other factors. These include technology transfers from England and the appeal of a highly mobile, low-cost labour-force for English investors like Richard Arkwright.
[192]
Scotland's natural resources in water power, black-band ironstone and coal were also important foundations for mechanised industry.
[193]
Religious fragmentation
[

]
Main article:
History of Christianity in Scotland
Ebenezer Erskine
whose actions led to the establishment of the
Secession Church
.
In the 1690s the Presbyterian establishment purged the land of Episcopalians and heretics, and made blasphemy a capital crime. Thomas Aitkenhead, the son of an Edinburgh surgeon, aged 18, was indicted for blasphemy by order of the Privy Council for calling the New Testament "The History of the Imposter Christ"; he was hanged in 1696.
[194]
Their extremism led to a reaction known as the "Moderate" cause that ultimately prevailed and opened the way for liberal thinking in the cities.
The early 18th century saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the
Church of Scotland
. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the hard-line
Evangelicals
and the theologically more tolerant
Moderate Party
. The battle was over fears of fanaticism by the former and the promotion of Enlightenment ideas by the latter. The Patronage Act of 1712 was a major blow to the evangelicals, for it meant that local landlords could choose the minister, not the members of the congregation.
[195]
Schisms erupted as the evangelicals left the main body, starting in 1733 with the
First Secession
headed by figures including
Ebenezer Erskine
. The second schism in 1761 lead to the foundation of the independent
Relief Church
.
[196]
These churches gained strength in the
Evangelical Revival
of the later 18th century.
[197]
A key result was the main Presbyterian church was in the hands of the Moderate faction, which provided critical support for the Enlightenment in the cities.
Long after the triumph of the Church of Scotland in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to an old-fashioned Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices. The remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the
SSPCK
missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society.
[198]
Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions also grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. Also important was Episcopalianism, which had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes of regime in the 17th century. Since most Episcopalians had given their support to the Jacobite rebellions in the early 18th century, they also suffered a decline in fortunes.

Literature

Literature of Scotland
Robert Burns
(1759-1796) exalted as Scotland's national poet.
Although Scotland increasingly adopted the English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation.
Allan Ramsay
(1686-1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the
Habbie stanza
as a
poetic form
.
[199]
James Macpherson
was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by
Ossian
, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the
Classical
epics
.
Fingal
written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the
Romantic movement
in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing
Herder
and
Goethe
.
[200]
Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.
[201]
Both the major literary figures of the following century,
Robert Burns
and Walter Scott, would be highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the
national poet
of Scotland and a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected
folk songs
from across Scotland, often revising or
adapting
them. His poem (and song) "
Auld Lang Syne
" is often sung at
Hogmanay
(the last day of the year), and "
Scots Wha Hae
" served for a long time as an unofficial
national anthem
of the country.

A legacy of the Reformation in Scotland was the aim of having a school in every parish, which was underlined by an act of the Scottish parliament in 1696 (reinforced in 1801). In rural communities this obliged local landowners (heritors) to provide a schoolhouse and pay a schoolmaster, while ministers and local
presbyteries
oversaw the quality of the education. The headmaster or "dominie" was often university educated and enjoyed high local prestige.
[203]
The kirk schools were active in the rural lowlands but played a minor role in the Highlands, the islands, and in the fast-growing industrial towns and cities.
[204]
[205]
The schools taught in English, not in Gaelic, because that language was seen as a leftover of Catholicism and was not an expression of Scottish nationalism.
[206]
In cities such as Glasgow the Catholics operated their own schools, which directed their youth into clerical and middle class occupations, as well as religious vocations.
[207]
A "democratic myth" emerged in the 19th century to the effect that many a "lad of pairts" had been able to rise up through the system to take high office and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England.
[208]
Historical research has largely undermined the myth. Kirk schools were not free, attendance was not compulsory and they generally imparted only basic literacy such as the ability to read the Bible. Poor children, starting at age 7, were done by age 8 or 9; the majority were finished by age 11 or 12. The result was widespread basic reading ability; since there was an extra fee for writing, half the people never learned to write. Scots were not significantly better educated than the English and other contemporary nations. A few talented poor boys did go to university, but usually they were helped by aristocratic or gentry sponsors. Most of them became poorly paid teachers or ministers, and none became important figures in the Scottish Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution.
[209]
By the 18th century there were five universities in Scotland, at
Edinburgh
,
Glasgow
,
St. Andrews
and
King's
and
Marischial
Colleges in Aberdeen, compared with only two in England. Originally oriented to clerical and legal training, after the religious and political upheavals of the 17th century they recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry. It helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and to put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking.

An election advertisement for Scottish Labour leader
Keir Hardie
Scotland's transformation into a rich leader of modern industry came suddenly and unexpectedly.
[140]
The population grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.
[210]
The economy, long based on agriculture,
[140]
began to industrialise after 1790. At first the leading industry, based in the west, was the spinning and weaving of cotton. In 1861, the American Civil War suddenly cut off the supplies of raw cotton and the industry never recovered. Thanks to its many entrepreneurs and engineers, and its large stock of easily mined coal, Scotland became a world centre for engineering, shipbuilding, and locomotive construction, with steel replacing iron after 1870.
[211]
Party politics
[
edit
]
The
Scottish Reform Act 1832
increased the number of Scottish MPs and significantly widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes. From this point until the end of the century, the Whigs and (after 1859) their successors the
Liberal Party
, managed to gain a majority of the Westminster Parliamentary seats for Scotland, although these were often outnumbered by the much larger number of English and Welsh Conservatives.
[212]
The English-educated Scottish peer
Lord Aberdeen
(1784-1860) led a coalition government from 1852 to 1855, but in general very few Scots held office in the government.
[213]
From the mid-century there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and when the Conservative
Lord Salisbury
became prime minister in 1885 he responded to pressure by reviving the post of
Secretary of State for Scotland
, which had been in abeyance since 1746.
[214]
He appointed the
Duke of Richmond
, a wealthy landowner who was both Chancellor of Aberdeen University and Lord Lieutenant of Banff.
[215]
Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included the Tory,
Peelite
and Liberal
William Gladstone
, who held the office four times between 1868 and 1894.
[216]
The first Scottish Liberal to become prime minister was
the Earl of Rosebery
, from 1894 to 1895, like Aberdeen before him a product of the English education system.
[217]
In the later 19th century the issue of
Irish Home Rule
led to a split among the Liberals, with a minority breaking away to form the
Liberal Unionists
in 1886.
[212]
The growing importance of the working classes was marked by
Keir Hardie
's success in the
1888 Mid Lanarkshire by-election
, leading to the foundation of the
Scottish Labour Party
, which was absorbed into the
Independent Labour Party
in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.
[218]
Industrial expansion
[
edit
]
New Lanark
cotton mill on the banks of the River Clyde, founded in 1786.
From about 1790 textiles became the most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the
American Civil War
cut off the supplies of raw cotton.
[219]
The industry never recovered, but by that time Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.
[220]
Coal mining continued to grow into the 20th century, producing the fuel to heat homes, factories and drive steam engines locomotives and steamships. By 1914, there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland.
[221]
The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs;
[222]
that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled the miners everywhere, with a strong emphasis on masculinity, equalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.
[223]
Britain was the world leader in the construction of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between
Monkland
and
Kirkintilloch
, opened in 1831.
[224]
Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the
Aberdeen Angus
to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.
[225]
By 1900, Scotland had 3500 miles of railway; their main economic contribution was moving supplies in and product out for heavy industry, especially coal-mining.
[226]
"Shipping on the Clyde", by
John Atkinson Grimshaw
, 1881.
Scotland was already one of the most urbanised societies in Europe by 1800.
[227]
The industrial belt ran across the country from southwest to northeast; by 1900 the four industrialised counties of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Dunbartonshire, and Ayrshire contained 44 per cent of the population.
[228]
Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world, and known as "the Second City of the Empire" after London.
[229]
Shipbuilding on
Clydeside
(the river Clyde through Glasgow and other points) began when the first small yards were opened in 1712 at the
Scott family's
shipyard at Greenock. After 1860, the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre.
Clydebuilt
became an industry benchmark of quality, and the river's shipyards were given contracts for warships.
[230]
Public health and welfare
[
edit
]
The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.
[231]
The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to endorse government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.
[232]
Intellectual life
[
edit
]
Walter Scott
whose
Waverley Novels
helped define Scottish identity in the 19th century.
While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,
[172]
disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the mathematicians and physicists
James Clerk Maxwell
,
Lord Kelvin
, and the engineers and inventors
James Watt
and
William Murdoch
, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain.
[233]
In literature the most successful figure of the mid-nineteenth century was
Walter Scott
, who began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work,
Waverley
in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.
[234]
It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.
[235]
In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations.
Robert Louis Stevenson
's work included the
urban Gothic
novella
Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde
(1886), and played a major part in developing the historical adventure in books like
Kidnapped
and
Treasure Island
.
Arthur Conan Doyle
's
Sherlock Holmes
stories helped found the tradition of detective fiction. The "
kailyard tradition
" at the end of the century, brought elements of fantasy and
folklore
back into fashion as can be seen in the work of figures like
J. M. Barrie
, most famous for his creation of
Peter Pan
, and
George MacDonald
, whose works, including
Phantasies
, played a major part in the creation of the fantasy genre.
[236]
Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The
Glasgow School
, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the
Celtic Revival
the
Arts and Crafts Movement
, and
Japonisme
, which found favour throughout the
modern art
world of continental Europe and helped define the
Art Nouveau
style. Among the most prominent members were the loose collective of The Four: acclaimed architect
Charles Rennie Mackintosh
, his wife the painter and
glass artist
Margaret MacDonald
, her sister the artist
Frances
, and her husband, the artist and teacher
Herbert MacNair
.

Decline and romanticism of the Highlands
[
edit
]
Main article:
Highlands of Scotland
David Wilkie
's flattering portrait of the
kilted
King George IV
.
This period saw a process of rehabilitation for highland culture. Tartan had already been adopted for highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the
Napoleonic Wars
in 1815, but by the 19th century it had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people. In the 1820s, as part of the
Romantic revival
, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe,
[238]
[239]
prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's Ossian cycle
[240]
[241]
and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels. The world paid attention to their literary redefinition of Scottishness, as they forged an image largely based on characteristics in polar opposition to those associated with England and modernity. This new identity made it possible for Scottish culture to become integrated into a wider European and North American context, not to mention tourist sites, but it also locked in a sense of "otherness" which Scotland began to shed only in the late 20th century.
[242]
Scott's "staging" of the royal
Visit of King George IV to Scotland
in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan, resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and became a major symbol of Scottish identity.
[243]
The fashion for all things Scottish was maintained by
Queen Victoria
, who helped secure the identity of Scotland as a tourist resort, with
Balmoral Castle
in Aberdeenshire becoming a major royal residence from 1852.
[239]
Land use and ownership
[
edit
]
Despite these changes the highlands remained very poor and traditional, with few connections to the uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution.
[244]
A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of
Argyll
,
Atholl
,
Buccleuch
, and
Sutherland
, owned large amounts of land and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs.
[245]
Particularly after the end of the boom created by the
Revolutionary
and Napoleonic Wars (1790-1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans.
Potato blight
reached the Highlands in 1846, where 150,000 people
faced disaster
because their food supply was largely potatoes (with a little herring, oatmeal and milk). They were rescued by an effective emergency relief system that stands in dramatic contrast to the failures of relief in
Ireland
.
[246]
As the famine continued, landlords, charities and government agencies provided "assisted passages" for destitute tenants to emigrate to Canada and Australia; in excess of 16,000 people emigrated, with most travelling in 1851.

Caused by the advent of
refrigeration
and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.
[247]
Land prices subsequently plummeted, too, and accelerated the process of the so-called "Balmoralisation" of Scotland, an era in the second half of the 19th century that saw an increase in tourism and the establishment of large estates dedicated to
field sports
like
deer stalking
and
grouse shooting
, especially in the Scottish Highlands.
[247]
[248]
The process was named after
Balmoral estate
, purchased by Queen Victoria in 1848, that fueled the romanticisation of upland Scotland and initiated an influx of the newly wealthy acquiring similar estates in the following decades.
[247]
[248]
By the late 19th century just 118 people owned half of Scotland, with nearly 60 per cent of the whole country being part of shooting estates.
[247]
While their relative importance has somewhat declined due to changing recreational interests throughout the 20th century, deer stalking and grouse shooting remain of prime importance on many private estates in Scotland.
[247]
[249]
Rural life
[
edit
]
The unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional subject and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The politically powerless poor crofters embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian
revival
after 1800,
[250]
and the breakaway "Free Church" after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. This energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords, preparing them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the
Highland Land League
.
[251]
Violence began on the
Isle of Skye
when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quieted when the government stepped in passing the
Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886
to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless.
[252]
In 1885, three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, leading to explicit security for the Scottish smallholders; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants; and creating a
Crofting Commission
. The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the Liberal Party gained most of their votes.

Emigration

The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.
[254]
Even with the development of industry there were insufficient good jobs; as a result, during the period 1841-1931, about 2 million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.
[255]
Scotland lost a much higher proportion of its population than England and Wales,
[256]
reaching perhaps as much as 30.2 per cent of its
natural increase
from the 1850s onwards.
[257]
This not only limited Scotland's population increase, but meant that almost every family lost members due to emigration and, because more of them were young males, it skewed the sex and age ratios of the country.
[256]
Scots-born emigrants that played a leading role in the foundation and development of the United States included cleric and revolutionary
John Witherspoon
,
[258]
sailor
John Paul Jones
, industrialist and philanthropist

Religious schism and revival
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of Christianity in Scotland
Thomas Chalmers
statue in George Street, Edinburgh
After prolonged years of struggle, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the
General Assembly
and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted "intrusive" presentations to livings by patrons. The following "Ten Years' Conflict" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr
Thomas Chalmers
known as the Great
Disruption of 1843
. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate
Free Church of Scotland
. The evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.
[198]
Chalmers's ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation.
[263]
That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.
[264]
In the late 19th century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the
Free Presbyterian Church
in 1893.
[196]
There were, however, also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the
United Secession Church
in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the
United Presbyterian Church
, which in turn joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the
United Free Church of Scotland
. The removal of legislation on lay patronage would allow the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929. The schisms left small denominations including the
Free Presbyterians
and a remnant that had not merged in 1900 as the
Free Church
.
[196]
Catholic Emancipation
in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.
[196]
Episcopalianism also revived in the 19th century as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the
Episcopal Church in Scotland
in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the
Church of England
.
[196]
Baptist
,
Congregationalist
and
Methodist
churches had appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century,
[196]
partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches. From 1879 they were joined by the evangelical revivalism of the
Salvation Army
, which attempted to make major inroads in the growing urban centres.
[197]
Development of state education
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of education in Scotland
The Mearns Street Public School built for the
Greenock
Burgh School Board.
Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants, then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship, and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.
[265]
Overall administration was in the hands of the Scotch (later Scottish) Education Department in London.
[266]
Education was now compulsory from five to thirteen and many new board schools were built. Larger urban school boards established "higher grade" (secondary) schools as a cheaper alternative to the burgh schools. The Scottish Education Department introduced a Leaving Certificate Examination in 1888 to set national standards for secondary education and in 1890 school fees were abolished, creating a state-funded national system of free basic education and common examinations.
[208]
At the beginning of the 19th century, Scottish universities had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and could leave without qualifications. After two commissions of enquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in 1858 and 1889, the curriculum and system of graduation were reformed to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. Entrance examinations equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered 3-year ordinary and 4-year honours degrees and separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum.
[267]
The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as well as the upper class. It prepared students for non-commercial careers in government, the law, medicine, education, and the ministry and a smaller group for careers in science and engineering.
[268]
St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Licentiate in Arts (LLA), which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.

Fishing
[
edit
]
The years before the First World War were the golden age of the inshore fisheries. Landings reached new heights, and Scottish catches dominated Europe's herring trade,
[270]
accounting for a third of the British catch. High productivity came about thanks to the transition to more productive steam-powered boats, while the rest of Europe's fishing fleets were slower because they were still powered by sails.

[212]
usually known as the Conservatives in England and Wales, they adopted the name

Scots played a major part in the leadership of UK political parties producing a Conservative Prime Minister in

[

Further information:
History of the United Kingdom during World War I
Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War.
[274]
It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money, engaging with the conflict with some enthusiasm.
[275]
Scotland's industries were directed at the war effort. For example,
the Singer Clydebank sewing machine factory
received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuses, and aeroplane parts, as well as grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70 per cent female at war's end.
[276]
With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.
[277]
[278]
Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment, were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female-dominated jute industry limited male employment, had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city.
[279]
Concern for their families' standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled.
[280]
After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the
Battle of Loos
, where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units.
[279]
Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead.
[281]
Some areas, like the thinly populated island of
Lewis and Harris
, suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain.
[279]
Clydeside shipyards and the nearby engineering shops were the major centres of war industry in Scotland. In Glasgow, radical agitation led to industrial and political unrest that continued after the war ended.
[282]
After the end of the war in June 1919 the
German fleet interned at Scapa Flow was scuttled
by its German crews, to avoid its ships being taken over by the victorious allies.
[283]
Economic boom and stagnation
[
edit
]
A 1923 advert for
William Beardmore and Company
, Clydeside, who employed 40,000 workers at its height
A boom was created by the First World War, with the shipbuilding industry expanding by a third, but a serious depression hit the economy by 1922.
[284]
The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialised skills.
[285]
The main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the Second World War.
[286]
A few industries did grow, such as chemicals and whisky, which developed a global market for premium "Scotch".
[287]
However, in general the Scottish economy stagnated leading to growing unemployment and political agitation among industrial workers.
[272]
Interwar politics
[
edit
]
After World War I the Liberal Party began to disintegrate and Labour emerged as the party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands. As a result, the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared
Bolshevik
revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century.
[212]
The fear of the left had been fuelled by the emergence of a radical movement led by militant trades unionists.
John MacLean
emerged as a key political figure in what became known as
Red Clydeside
, and in January 1919, the British Government, fearful of a revolutionary uprising, deployed tanks and soldiers in central Glasgow. Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base in the Irish Catholic working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing and rent issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; in the face of heavy unemployment the workers' mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.

With all the main parties committed to the Union, new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the
National Party of Scotland
in 1928 and
Scottish Party
in 1930. They joined to form the
Scottish National Party
(SNP) in 1934, with the goal of creating an
independent Scotland
, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.

In World War II, Prime Minister
Winston Churchill
appointed Labour politician
Tom Johnston
as
Secretary of State for Scotland
in February 1941; he controlled Scottish affairs until the war ended. He launched numerous initiatives to promote Scotland, attracting businesses and new jobs through his new Scottish Council of Industry. He set up 32 committees to deal with social and economic problems, ranging from juvenile delinquency to sheep farming. He regulated rents, and set up a prototype national health service, using new hospitals set up in the expectation of large numbers of casualties from German bombing. His most successful venture was setting up a system of hydro electricity using water power in the Highlands.

In World War II, despite extensive bombing by the Luftwaffe, Scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.
[291]
Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by 2 inches (51 mm).

End of mass emigration
[

While emigration began to tail off in England and Wales after the First World War,
[256]
it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931.
[291]
The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks of family and friends who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to retrace their paths.
[298]
When the
Great Depression
hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada and the numbers leaving fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass emigrations that had opened in the mid-18th century.

In the early 20th century there was a new surge of activity in Scottish literature, influenced by
modernism
and resurgent nationalism, known as the Scottish Renaissance.
[300]
The leading figure in the movement was
Hugh MacDiarmid
(the pseudonym of Christopher Murray Grieve). MacDiarmid attempted to revive the Scots language as a medium for serious literature in poetic works including "
A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle
" (1936), developing a form of
Synthetic Scots
that combined different regional dialects and archaic terms.
[300]
Other writers that emerged in this period, and are often treated as part of the movement, include the poets
Edwin Muir
and
William Soutar
, the novelists
Neil Gunn
,
George Blake
,
Nan Shepherd

A. J. Cronin
